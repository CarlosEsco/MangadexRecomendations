  "description": "I became the wife of a man who already had a lover.\r\nSo, I should do my best to help him remain faithful to her, right?\r\n\r\nBut how did I end up destroying the bed with him on our first night together...?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nAristine is a royal princess who's been confined all her life, as she is highly disfavored by the emperor.\r\nBut the truth is, as the possessor of the [Royal Sight], she can see the past, present, and future.\r\n\r\nThe emperor sends her off to die in a political marriage arranged with the prince of their enemy country, rumored to be a bloodthirsty savage, but...\r\nHer soon-to-be husband, the so-called &quot;savage,&quot; is far more normal than the rumors suggest.\r\n\r\n&quot;Still, he's taken, so he's off-limits for me. I'll just focus on making lots of money from now on!&quot;\r\n\r\nWill Aristine be able to fulfill her dream of living a luxurious, wealthy life?\r\nOr will she be able to kill two birds with one stone and win over her husband as well?",
