  "description": "A university student is threatened by an unknown old man. &quot;I hate people like you! Your fate is to die,&quot; said the man with an undisguised persecution complex. &quot;To escape this hurt, I'll do only enjoyable things 'till my end!&quot; he argues, in his extreme desperation. In the midst of his delusions, the man propositions him, saying, &quot;Do you want to have sex?&quot; while he takes off his clothes. Then, little by little, he begins to find the suffering face of the man cute?! &quot;Welcome home! The rice will be done in 30 minutes, so shall we have sex?&quot; &quot;You should hurry up and escape from here&hellip;!&quot; Can love bloom in this lifestyle of confinement?",
