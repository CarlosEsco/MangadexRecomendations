  "description": "About to freeze to death on a day of heavy snow, Kento is saved by his neighbor Soushi. Dressed all in black, taciturn and scary-looking, Soushi seems hard to approach, but his eyes, almost hidden by his long hair, shine as if pleading for something. After that day, the two of them end up eating together every day for one year. Kento, while hiding the fact that he's gay, doesn't want the peaceful and happy time they share to come to an end. Can he keep a lid on his feelings...?!\r\n\r\nFrom Peach Kyoudai:\r\n\r\nThis is the story before I welcome the second spring after my encounter with Soushi-san...\r\n\r\nKento, a poor graduate student, is about to be frozen to death on a heavy snowfall day, when he is rescued by his neighbor, Soushi. Soushi might be dressed in all-black, is taciturn, has a fierce gaze, and is hard to approach, but his eyes hidden behind his long hair sway, like he longs to say something. It's been a year since they've been sharing meals together. Kento fears that his days of happiness will come to an end, which is why he hides the fact that he's gay from him.\r\nBut, in the end, will he able to continue to live like this while shutting out his ever growing feelings...?",
