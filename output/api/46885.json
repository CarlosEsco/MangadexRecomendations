  "description": "This book is for anyone who would like to get a good overview of linear algebra in a relatively short amount of time. \r\nThose who will get the most out of The Manga Guide to Linear Algebra are: \r\n- University students about to take linear algebra, or those who are already tak&shy;ing the course and need a helping hand \r\n- Students who have taken linear algebra in the past but still don't really under&shy;stand what it's all about\r\n- High school students who are aiming to enter a technical university \r\n- Anyone else with a sense of humor and an interest in mathematics! \r\n\r\nThe book contains the following parts: \r\nChapter 1: What Is Linear Algebra? \r\nChapter 2: The Fundamentals \r\nChapters 3 and 4: Matrices \r\nChapters 5 and 6: Vectors \r\nChapter 7: Linear Transformations \r\nChapter 8: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors \r\n\r\nMost chapters are made up of a manga section and a text section. While skip&shy;ping the text parts and reading only the manga will give you a quick overview of each subject, I recommend that you read both parts and then review each subject in more detail for maximal effect. This book is meant as a complement to other, more comprehensive literature, not as a substitute. \r\nI would like to thank my publisher, Ohmsha, for giving me the opportunity to write this book, as well as Iroha Inoue, the book's illustrator. I would also like to express my gratitude towards re_akino, who created the scenario, and everyone at Trend Pro who made it possible for me to convert my manuscript into this manga. I also received plenty of good advice from Kazuyuki Hiraoka and Shizuka Hori. I thank you all.",
