  "description": "Welcome to one of the most disturbing minds in Japanese manga! Hideshi Hino has long been considered a master of the horror manga genre since his coming out in the late seventies. And the four stories in Lullabies from Hell will show you how demented the man can be. \r\n\r\nThe self-titled first chapter introduces you to the author himself, a horror quasi-biography of sorts. The second story tells of Hino's having willed his pregnant wife into birthing a horrible reptile baby that eats puppies and children! And you can imagine how the stories progress from there. \r\n\r\nTake a look inside the mind of a madman! Published in the popular, unretouched and unflopped manga format, Lullabies from Hell might make sleeping a bit of a challenge!",
