  "description": "Yukari is a &ldquo;bad girl.&rdquo; She rebels against her controlling mother by dyeing her hair, polishing her nails and having an older boyfriend. Miki is a &ldquo;good girl.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s tall, quiet and smart. And a bit aloof.\r\n\r\nThe two are forced to share a double desk at the beginning of the term which annoys Yukari no end. Yukari&rsquo;s initial reaction is disdain and derision for Miki&rsquo;s behavior. But, one day, after school, she sees Miki in the Art Room, gently kissing a statue of Mars and her heart starts to race. When someone comes up from behind, both Miki and Yukari know that they&rsquo;ve been seen, and everything changes between them.",
