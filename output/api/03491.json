  "description": "Keaton is the Son of an English woman of noble birth and a Japanese zoologist. He went to England at the age of five with his mother after his parents' divorce. There he learned archeology at Oxford University, where he met his wife with whom he has a daughter (Yuriko). They divorced after five years. He works as an operative/detective for Lloyds of London where he's known for his abilities he acquired as a master sergeant in the SAS and as a veteran of the Falklands War, and was one of the members of the Iran Embassy incident. This helps him carry out his dangerous work of insurance investigator. His works at Lloyds, but his dream is excavating the ancient civilization in a Danube basin. His title is &quot;master&quot; because the SAS training camp' teacher told him that he wouldn't be able to be a &quot;professor&quot; in his fighting style, but a &quot;master&quot; at best. The manga does portray many facets of Keaton. Not only his role as a detective, but also his humanistic views on nature, family and culture.",
