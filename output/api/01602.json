  "description": "The main character Udagawa Gosuke has inherited his father's dojo, mainly because his father and elder brother were made to commit hara-kiri. He wasn't really supposed to get it simply because he's a second son.\r\n\r\nDue to the way his father and brother died, he doesn't have a whole lot of self confidence, so he practices fencing daily at a nearby dojo.\r\n\r\nHowever, because the people at that dojo are asses, he soon tries to invent a dojo and a style for people who just want to enjoy themselves.\r\n\r\nHowever, what really sets this aside from most shounen is that the male and female main characters are actually married.\r\n\r\nHis wife, Udagawa Shino, is the younger sister of his senpai, and is a bit... weird, to say the least. She makes rabbit masks to help bring in a bit of money, although to say that she's obsessed with rabbits would be an understatement. She claims it's because &quot;the rabbits will someday reach the moon.&quot;\r\n\r\nWhen Gosuke founds his new dojo, he decides to create a style of swordsmanship known as &quot;Rabbit Style Fencing.&quot;",
