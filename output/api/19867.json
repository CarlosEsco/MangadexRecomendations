  "description": "Sayo is a &quot;modern&quot; and uninhibited woman whose greatest passion, however, is her work. Her workaholics ended up removing all the men with whom she had a relationship, who complained about how much Sayo was &quot;married&quot; to her work. One day, a new employee starts working in her company; Ryouichi Kiriyama seems different from any other man she has ever met, but she still doesn't know that underneath Kiriyama's facade, he hides something else... Will their relationship ascend the 'game' they've placed themselves in?[hr]Retail: [url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B0753HB58L]Amazon.co.jp[/url] (chapters)",
