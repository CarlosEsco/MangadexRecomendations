  "description": "Jun, the third-generation heir of a chaebol. \r\nIt was one of those days, in the midst of a period of ennui, where Jun felt he may go mad with boredom. While hanging out with his friends in a bar&rsquo;s &ldquo;hidden room&rdquo; and starting the day with &ldquo;fun&rdquo; (drinking and playing around with girls), Jun sat in a daze, pondering the difference between life and death. At that moment, a waiter entered the room, and the heart Jun believed to be dead leap back to life.",
