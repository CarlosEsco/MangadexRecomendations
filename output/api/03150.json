  "description": "A collection of oneshots.\r\n\r\nHatshepsut - Beginning in 1511 B.C. Egypt, where two sisters -- the clever Menou and the beautiful but spacey Seshen -- are taken in by the family of the pharaoh for their ability to heal wounds. There, they meet Hatshepsut, the beautiful androgynous daughter of the pharaoh and future queen, who is said to be more suited to rule than her husband. She and Seshen quickly take a liking to each other, much to Menou's displeasure.\r\n\r\nHatshepsut II - A look into Hatshepsut's childhood, as she grew from a simple tomboy to a girl determined to become pharaoh.\r\n\r\nOther oneshots: Chimaera, Wadatsumi no Irokonomiya, Sphinx",
