  "description": "Is there someone whom you desperately wish to see dead? If you want your enemies and rivals eliminated, free-of-charge and with no possibility of the crime being traced back to you, all you need to do is leave a message for &quot;Usobuki Tadashi&quot; in a certain telephone booth at a certain park.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards, a black-suited man with cold, crimson eyes will meet with you and confirm the target. He cannot be prosecuted, for he kills through the power of suggestion and the clever arrangement of events. He will accept any request: regardless of whether the target is saint or sinner, and no matter how foolish, cruel or misguided the client... All with a mocking smile on his face that belies his quiet amusement in the face of humankind's never-ending folly.\r\n\r\n[url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=18867]See AnimeNewsNetwork for live action movie.[/url]",
