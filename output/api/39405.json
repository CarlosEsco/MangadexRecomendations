  "description": "The life of a Japanese salaryman or OL (office lady) can be a thoroughly depressing one. Waking up early, working all day, staying out late for (mandatory) drinks with clients and coworkers, and then catching a few hours of sleep if you&rsquo;re lucky, only to repeat it again and again and again.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a &quot;Single OL&quot; and her pitiful lifestyle.\r\n\r\n[url=https://twitter.com/black9arrows][b]Author's Twitter.[/b][/url]",
