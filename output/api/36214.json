He came back days later to apologize and order the commission of a new suit. As time went by, Takumi started taking an interest in Takano-sama. On the night Takumi was to deliver the suit, Takano-sama confessed that they had met once more before he came in the shop&hellip;\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH :\r\nUn jour, un client a fait irruption dans le magasin de confection de Takumi, demandant &agrave; acheter un costume qui ne lui allait pas bien &ndash; mais il &eacute;tait tellement press&eacute; qu'il n'a pas ou rester assez longtemps pour le faire ajuster ou m&ecirc;me prendre son re&ccedil;u.\r\nIl est revenu quelques jours plus tard pour s'excuser et commander un nouveau costume. Au fil du temps, Takumi commence &agrave; s'int&eacute;resser &agrave; Takano-sama.",
