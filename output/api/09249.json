  "description": "1-3) The Cupid Who Ran Off \r\n(Kakedashita Cupid)\r\nMayumi is a shy high school girl who watches Yamano from the other side of the fence after school; she loves the exhilarating moment when he high jumps and is flying through the blue sky. She can see it even when she closes her eyes. But is she so intent on watching Yamano-kun... that she doesn't notice that he's watching her, too? \r\n\r\n4) I Can Hear the Footsteps \r\n(Ashiato ga Kikoeru)\r\nShizuka's charm bracelet comes with a condition: She can have any wish she wants if she can suppress her favorite thing for two months. Her wish is to be a more grown up woman, but handsome, and surprisingly childish classmate Naoto may make that impossible.\r\n\r\n5) Peter Pan I Love You \r\n(Piitaa Pan no I love you)\r\nWhen flighty Eri accidentally injuries Takumi's hand she finds out what a sexist he is. He thinks girls are loud, spoiled, and cry easily. Eri is determined to prove him wrong. However, Takumi begins to change Eri's opinion of him as well..\r\n\r\n6) Of Course I Can't Wait Until Nightfall \r\n(Mochiron Yorumade Matenai) from the series 'Yoru Made Matenai'\r\nHaruka's grades have been falling, and she's pretty sure she knows the reason: Her new stepbrother and affectionate lover Tsukasa. To keep herself from being distracted, Haruka imposes a no kissing rule on Tsukasa. But he's not going to give up without a fight...",
