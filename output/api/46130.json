  "description": "Wi Mokhwa was given another chance at life. Her first life had been worse than hell, therefore, at her untimely death, life came flowing back into her.\r\n\r\nAt fifteen, she fell in love easily and believed Lee Gajun to be her destiny. There wouldn&rsquo;t have been anything more perfect for eternity. However, facing death, Wi Mokhwa had to accept her cruel end. Her life at fifteen had been futile and was where her misery started.\r\n\r\nRegretting her life, she was given another chance. This time she has Lee Jejun's sincere feelings to protect her and stand by her side. He was willing to be her light even inside a dark world. This life was not doomed to fail.\r\n\r\nRevenge, salvation, and a miracle.\r\nThis is her true life, the second life where it all begins again.",
