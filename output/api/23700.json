  "description": "An ordinary boy called Sherlock Doyle is captured and forced to put on his twin sister&rsquo;s dress by the Emperor&rsquo;s diplomat to be shipped to a small country called Ehren. His genius sister, Glinda, went missing two days before she&rsquo;s supposed to be sent to Ehren to be a royal tutor for the King&rsquo;s children. The sudden life change is too overwhelming for Sherlock, but he sees no way out. Later, he finds out the disturbing truth about the kingdom&rsquo;s intention with his sister.\r\n\r\nScanulator has pre-added watermarks, not added by myself nor (possibly) a third party.\r\nSee [url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726015404/http://dragonflyscans.org/manga/i_m_a_royal_tutor_in_my_sister_s_dress/]The Web Archive[/url] for more information.",
