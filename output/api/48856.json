  "description": "Longing to be a normie, I, Renako Amaori, am finally making my high school debut after working so hard for it. However due to my communication impairment, I have a gloomy aura. And after being in the normie group day in day out, I got so exhausted and said &ldquo;I can't do this anymore,&rdquo; and reached my limit!\r\n\r\nDuring that time, I accidentally met the top student of our school. Perfect in face and figure unrivaled in sword and pen, our school's best high school girl: Mai Odzuka. We found in each other someone who we could open to and talk about our own troubles. What a nice friend I made, now I can surely get back on my own feet...is what I thought!\r\n\r\n&ldquo;It seems that you, even as a girl, have made me fall in love with you.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;...What!&rdquo; Mai suddenly confessed to me. Wait! What about our friendship?\r\n\r\nAnd so, we now have different feelings we can&rsquo;t tell each other: friendship or a romantic relationship. We&rsquo;re now presenting each other its benefits and put them into practice to see what kind of relationship works best for us. Will I succeed with a successful high school life&hellip;?\r\n\r\nArt/Manga adaptation by Monsieur, original light novel by Mikami Teren. Light novel illustrations by Takeshima Eku.",
