  "description": "Hane Hajime, who spends his life lazing around and being dependent on others, is twenty-two years old. One day, having lost his way, he wakes up in a blood-stained bed, with the lower half of his body in full view and his rear end stinging-not surprisingly because he&rsquo;s serviced a pair of twins! The curtain rises on completely innocent Hane&rsquo;s new lifestyle as it starts to head for trouble. While he&rsquo;s taken aback by unique adults, he finds kindness... or perhaps it&rsquo;s love.",
