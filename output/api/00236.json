  "description": "I resigned from St.Cattlya Kindergarten because I want to teach at a High School. One day, I received a letter from Yamasaki-sensei. Oh, is that a love letter? But why the clues at the letter guide me to the St. Cattlya Primary? Oh,NO! I have to teach my previous students again. Where's those young high school girls I always dreamed of?\r\n\r\nIn this direct sequel to Shiritsu St. Cattlya Youchien, we follow the story of teacher, Kuroda Shuuichi, and his adorable students as they move up to elementary school. Excited to be moving towards becoming a real teacher, Kuroda leaves the preschool only to learn that his new position is the elementary school with his old students. The incredibly unique kids are back including the Fuurin and Katori twins, the cheerful Miki, the shy Tsumugi, calm and collected Nazuki, and the panda hat wearing Daniel. The adorable yet weirdly mature children will capture Kuroda sensei&rsquo;s heart once again.",
