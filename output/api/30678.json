  "description": "In this second volume of four novelas, Hino continues his theme of the intertwining of innocence and evil in shojo horror manga style. When Yuki and friends discover a corpse reflected in the bathroom mirror at school, they believe it to be a joke. However, gruesome events unfold that will lead them to regret they were ever so foolish. Other stories include a girl whose beauty makes her the victim of a terror campaign; another who is bullied by a teacher but, in death, achieves her revenge; and classroom 3.7, into which students enter but never leave.\r\n\r\nThe Hino Horror series:\r\nHino Horror Volume 1: The Red Snake (\u8d64\u3044\u86c7 Akai Hebi)\r\nHino Horror Volume 2: The Bug Boy (\u6bd2\u866b\u5c0f\u50e7 Dokumushi Kozou)\r\nHino Horror Volume 3: Oninbo and the Bugs from Hell (\u5730\u7344\u866b\u3092\u98df\u3046! \u9b3c\u3093\u307c Jigoku Mushi Woku!
