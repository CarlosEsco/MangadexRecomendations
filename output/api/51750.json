  "description": "The greatest evil was resurrected, and the youngest high-ranked magician, Diarin, died three times while trying to stop it, and was unable to protect those close to her.\r\n\r\nIn her fourth reincarnation:\r\nHer life is at danger thanks to her eternal soul's fate, and she needs a different strategy to escape her future. Diarin promises divorce when she finds the prince that was engaged since he was a child, in exchange for him staying in her territory for one year. However&hellip;\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nDiarin leaned towards Yejet as best as she could, to try and look as natural as possible.\r\n&quot;I will annul the engagement for you.&quot;\r\n&quot;Huh?&quot; Yejet asked again, after blankly saying &quot;Huh?&quot; in the moment along with the driver.\r\n\r\nYejet's gaze was very peculiar. It was only thanks to Diarin putting in all of her focus on Yejet, that allowed her to just barely notice that odd gaze. Yejet didn't take his eyes off of Diarin's once.\r\nHe asked her, &quot;Are you talking about Duke Concul?&quot;\r\nIt was a sentence spoken as quietly as Diarin's. Excluding the driver, no one could hear their conversation.\r\n\r\n&quot;No way. Do you think the duke would actually let go of Your Highness? If he could, he would probably tie you up with a rope as tight as he could.&quot;\r\n&quot;Then?&quot;\r\n\r\nDiarin in the quietest voice, as though ice might shatter if she spoke too loudly, &quot;I'm talking about you.&quot;",
