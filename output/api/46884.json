  "description": "Mi Yo-Chu, the second daughter of the general, was betrayed and killed by the Ding Palace's prince, Su Bu-Xiao, and her personal maid in her previous life and gets a chance to be reborn. &quot;This time, I will protect those dear to me and not repeat the same mistakes twice.&quot; Despite that, she gets into the same scenario as when she fell for Su Bu-Xiao in her past life. Though this time, the so-called sophisticated young master seems to have changed, like he got a lot... dumber? He also clung to Mi Yo-Chu like crazy. That's because...the person currently inside of Su Bu-Xiao's body is a reincarnator from the 21st century! and currently he's trying to trigger the first event for meeting his capture target: the player gets in danger and is saved by the capture target, disregarding her own life. And so, he tangled a snake around his neck.",
