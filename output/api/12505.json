  "description": "Miki Terayama saved Teru from getting roughed up by some punks. They're both in love with other guys... but one thing leads to another, and they're fooling around. Teru acts like a stray dog that hasn't been fed in ten days. He consumes Miki's love quick and rough and that can be quite a pain in the butt!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAn entertaining romp from Modoru who has once again veered away from her dark side and visited the side of her humorous stories. Of course it's still rather twisted. \r\n\r\nA couple of high school delinquents (Teru and Miki) discover that despite being from opposing sides, they have no objection to a bit of a sheet tumble with one another. Doggie-style refers more to how one of them is referred to as a dog by the other. \r\n\r\nAfter their fourth time together, Teru and Miki finally have sex good enough to melt them both. However, they're still stuck in a weird place... more than friends with benefits, but not quite lovers. But now Miki's friend Kashiwa is demanding a meeting. What? Kashiwa's showing interest, and he wants a kiss...? \r\n\r\nThe series was named after the Slam Dunk doujinshi &quot;Dog Style&quot; Modoru wrote in 1994.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Polish / Polski:[/u][/b]\r\n[spoiler]Dw&oacute;ch licealnych delikwent&oacute;w odkrywa, \u017ce bycie po przeciwnych stronach nie przeszkadza we wsp&oacute;lnych \u0142&oacute;\u017ckowych igraszkach. \u017baden z nich nie jest anio\u0142kiem, i \u017caden z nich nie jest wolny od problem&oacute;w.
