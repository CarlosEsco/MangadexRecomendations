  "description": "Marie's life is nothing but work, and it's been way too long since her last love affair. In fact, it's so long that she might've forgotten how to even start one. Slowly, her miserable days pass by. Her only joy is going to a beauty salon, where she is captivated by the amazing technique of that salon's leading employee, Shinobu. One day, when she's heading to a meeting, she meets Shinomiya, the son of the owner of a large corporation. But, he looks exactly like Shinobu, the lady at the beauty salon! And to top it off, when Marie loses her balance and is about to fall over, Shinomiya catches her and touches her weak spot that only Shinobu knows about!",
