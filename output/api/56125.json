  "description": "Jae-jin Yeon will always be remembered as the kid that was bullied in school, with an unremarkable personality and forgettable appearance he was doomed to be average his whole life.\r\n\r\nUntil he laid eyes on popular model/actor/idol superstar Lex.\r\n\r\nStaring at Lex's poster Jae-jin had a thought, 'if I can't be myself I should just be someone else'\r\n\r\nJae-jin knew the world was full of fake people, pretending to be someone else, someone popular was a surefire way to be liked and avoid his average future. \r\n\r\n5 years later, University student Jae-jin now known as 'Robin' online is a social media star and aspiring model, known by everyone for his style and cool personality. \r\n\r\nRobin is the character created in Lex's image, a perfect replica of Lex painstakingly crafted over the years by researching and practicing non-stop. The way Robin talks, the way he dresses, the pictures he posts online, even his favourite ice-cream flavour all come from Lex. \r\n\r\nBut as his popularity grows he may just catch the attention of Lex himself.",
