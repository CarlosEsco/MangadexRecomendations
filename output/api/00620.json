  "description": "The adventures of Chii, a lost kitten taken in by a young couple with a toddler. While the family never intended to keep the kitten, Chii slowly claws herself a niche in their family: winning over everyone with her kitten idiocy and charm.\r\n\r\nChi is a mischievous newborn kitten who, while on a leisurely stroll with her family, finds herself lost. Separated from the warmth and protection of her mother, feels distraught. Overcome with loneliness she breaks into tears in a large urban park meadow, when she is suddenly rescued by a young boy named Yohei and his mother. The kitty is then quickly and quietly whisked away into the warm and inviting Yamada family apartment... where pets are strictly not permitted.\r\n\r\nThe following are links to AnimeNewsNetwork for the animes:\r\n[url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=9234]Season 1[/url]\r\n[url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=10707]Season 2[/url]\r\n[url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=18723]Adventure Season 1[/url]\r\n[url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=20740]Adventure Season 2[/url]\r\n[url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=20687]Side Story (OAV)[/url]",
