  "description": "The setting is ancient-China. Our main characters are poisonous (sometimes domesticated) harpy-like creatures, who get their poison and the ornate coloring that they&rsquo;re so proud of, from the toxic plants which they eat.\r\n\r\nThis is a yaoi focusing on the (somewhat fraught) relationship between two such harpies.\r\n\r\nIf you&rsquo;re here for a human x harpy relationship&hellip; Well, let&rsquo;s just say you won&rsquo;t be disappointed either.",
