Although content with his lot in life, Soutarou also wouldn't mind having a fateful encounter with a cute girl someday. Lucky for him, he comes home from school one day to find a girl sitting at his doorstep whom he's never seen before, but who happens to have the same red earrings as Meguru Satoi, a cool and good-looking guy at his school.",
