  "description": "He used to be the noble and ominous prince of Chiyou Palace. He was a cold and peaceful young man in the Snow Plains. He was a brother with a very different life and background, but was still loyal. He was an obedient, gentle, and never willful lover. He kills people like flies, he is a schemer and an executioner. He is also a blade, a chess piece, an offering to the shrine of power. Everything ends in the Snow Plains, and yet everything also begins there.",
