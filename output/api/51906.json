  "description": "&ldquo;Kikuma, kneel.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nI don&rsquo;t want to obey his orders, but somehow my body moved on its own. He fingered me, put a cock ring on me&hellip;I want to come, but I can&rsquo;t!\r\n\r\nAfter violating school regulations, the number one delinquent in his year &ndash; Teranishi Kikuma &ndash; is forced to change dorm rooms. Reluctantly accepting his fate, he heads for his new room, where he meets Uryuu Takasumi, the dorm leader. A strange feeling he has never experienced before overtakes him. His body tingles and he feels an urge to fight Takasumi&hellip;what the hell is this?\r\n\r\nWhen he breaks the rules again, Takasumi sets up a few conditions, and their master-slave relationship begins. &ldquo;If you follow the rules, you&rsquo;ll get a reward. If you break them, you&rsquo;ll be punished.&rdquo;",
