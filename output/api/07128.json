  "description": "Welcome to Harmonia Music Academy, a top-class, world-renowned institution of higher learning for musically gifted students and future defenders of mankind. Yes, that&rsquo;s right &ndash; heroes called &ldquo;Scratch&rdquo; to defend humanity. We meet our three unlikely heroes, Shuon Tempermento, Calma Perdentosi and Energico Apassio as they completely and utterly fail a critical Scratch placement exam without scoring so much as a single point. &ldquo;The Problematic Trio&rdquo;, as they have come to be known, will have to pull together to resolve Shoun&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s mysterious disappearance, the threat of impending war and cope with their own personal turmoil, all while their school careers are on the line. What will happen to them from now on? (Taken from Cave Scanlations)",
