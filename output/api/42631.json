  "description": "One night, Shunya picks up a man who has amnesia. It turns out that the man is actually Yuusei Saotome, the young CEO of the company that Shunya works for. He grows fond of Yuusei, but Shunya doesn't tell him the truth, and says he'll just live with Yuusei until he gets his memory back. He feels guilty about tricking Yuusei, but starts to really care for him. Then, one day, Yuusei says &quot;You're all I have&quot; and kisses Shunya!",
