  "description": "From Fifay.net:\r\nSumi is in love with Mitsuru, but he doesn't seem to be interested in her as a woman. Determined to look more sexy and mature, Sumi takes an experimental growth hormone that her scientist father has been developing.\r\n\r\nHowever, the medicine backfires. Instead of changing into a buxom femme fatale, Sumi changes into a beautiful young man! She--he--is so gorgeous and so cool that even Mitsuru begins to take notice. Although the new situation with Mitsuru is imperfect, Sumi discovers that she can be closer to her crush: they can talk man-to-man. Yet, being Mitsuru's friend also has a downside, particularly when he reveals that he is in love with a girl in his grade!",
