  "description": "Webnovel: [spoiler]When she met him for the first time, she just wanted to escape from him. From then on, however, she gradually got used to his company. He is the god of death to everyone else, but he will always give the barest hint of a smile to her. Whenever there was a danger, he would always help her like a real god fallen from the heaven, mocking her at the same time. With the lapse of time, her feelings for him was more than just dependence. If she doesn&rsquo;t love him, she wouldn&rsquo;t let him stay by her; If not, how would she feel so different&hellip;[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nFrom the initial encounter with his resistance to escape, and to get used to him by her side, and then later&mdash;&mdash;getting used to seeing him as a Killer God for others. But it happened to leave her with the shallow evil smile at the corner of her lips!\r\n\r\nTo be used to every emergency, he would fall from the sky like a God, while taunting at her, but also to help her!\r\n\r\nAs time passes, habits evolve into &quot;fond&quot;.\r\n\r\nIf you don't like him, how can you tolerate his constant entanglements? If you don't like him, how can you&hellip;",
