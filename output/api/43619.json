  "description": "Kiichi is a na&iuml;ve university student who can't shake off his Okayama dialect. Coming to Tokyo to live and enter university, he lives in a shared house accommodation with 7 other residents. The urban, good-looking salaryman, Arima, whom he meets there, takes good care of him and is kind and dependable like a big brother.\r\n\r\nSince jumping into the bath together almost immediately on the first day, Kiichi has been extremely unsettled by their overly close relationship. Kiichi can't stop the feeling of quickly becoming attracted to Arima, thinking &quot;It's gonna be tough if I'm spoiled like this!&quot;",
