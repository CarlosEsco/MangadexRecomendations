  "description": "It is 1880 at the all-boys school, Lacombrade Academy in France. Serge Battour is a cheerful and kind new student who is trying to fit in with the rest of the student body, despite the taboo of his gypsy heritage, made obvious by his dark skin. However, his roommate Gilbert Cocteau, known for sleeping with anyone at the school to manipulate them to his advantage, is not helping the situation, especially when he makes it his personal goal to bring about Serge's downfall. \r\n\r\nOriginally published in the 1970's, Kaze to Ki no Uta is considered by many to be the first true yaoi manga. In 1979, this series was awarded the prestigious Shogakukan Manga Award for shounen/shoujo manga.\r\n\r\nFor those who don't like yaoi - this manga is more of shounen-ai and the sex scenes are nothing like the ones you can see in modern yaoi mangas. A bit of warning: &quot;Kaze...&quot; includes scenes of rape and child abuse (but no shota).",
