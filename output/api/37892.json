  "description": "Almost out of nowhere, the horizon line was lifted. This grand machine split the Earth in two. Humankind started developing in strange ways, becoming as deviants.\r\n\r\nThe Earth we live on today was split in half. That&rsquo;s when things started to change for the better and for the worse. Deviants, humans that developed uncanny abilities, were shoved into pods and shot over the horizon line. As a response to this change, the Horizon project was initiated as if it were planned ahead of time. The Horizon project acted as a system where deviants protected themselves and their side of the world. This practice developed and changed as time went on. Taiga Stelios, the self-proclaimed &quot;Greatest&quot;, strives to get his name known far and wide. His goal is to reach the stars he admires and outshine each and every single one of them.\r\n\r\n[url=https://twitter.com/seakerzx]Author's Twitter[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=https://discord.gg/wVKzkJS]Author's Discord Server[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=https://www.patreon.com/Seaker]Author's Patreon[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=https://curiouscat.qa/seakerzx]Author's Curious Cat[/url]",
