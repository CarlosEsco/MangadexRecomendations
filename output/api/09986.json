  "url": "https://mangadex.org/manga/9986",
  "description": "A doujinshi that focuses on the relationship between Chie and Taniyama, the game\u2019s protagonist, as it develops over the course of their year together. Unlike many other similar doujinshi, Kimi no Tonari keeps the romance very low-key and tame, instead focusing more on the emotional aspects of their bond over the course of the story.",
