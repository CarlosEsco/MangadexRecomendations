  "description": "Despite being born as the daughter of a nanny, I considered myself blessed. With my loving mother, caring masters, and their three children, I couldn&rsquo;t have asked for a better life. \r\n\r\nHowever, this all changed during the year my mother and masters died of a plague. That was when I remembered who I was before this life. \r\n\r\nSomehow, I was reincarnated as a side character of an angsty reverse harem romance novel. The problem was that I was the final boss in this novel, the queen of snakes who uses the young masters, the future main villains, to send the Empire to ruin. \r\n\r\nI knew what I wanted to protect, at all costs.",
