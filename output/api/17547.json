  "description": "Billy is the guitarist for a relatively unknown band called The Idiots. On a fateful Wednesday, two perceived unrelated events occurred: (1) his idol passed away, and (2) his roommate stole both his money and guitar. Surrounding these two events is a series of chance meetings, painful realizations, excessive alcoholism, listlessness, flashbacks, and love. This is a terribly poignant story defining the unyielding love found between a vocalist and his guitarist.",
