  "description": "Living for the sole aim of escaping! \r\n\r\n&lsquo;Light of Rusbella&rsquo; was a depressing romance novel.\r\nWishing for a new life, Asili Ros&eacute; was reborn as the 8th wife of the Estrian Emperor.\r\nShe thought she was born with a golden spoon, but it was actually just a gilded spoon?\r\nOnce she realized that nothing but ruin awaited, she found a diary foreshadowing the future...\r\n\r\nIt foretold Asili&rsquo;s death by the hands of the Crown Prince, Castor!\r\n\r\n[&ldquo;What does the empire mean to you?&rdquo;\r\nAfter asking this, the Crown Prince smiled so very beautifully. And then he killed me.]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Asili kept coming back to life, and continued to be killed over and over again. As she continued to relive her deaths, she slowly lost her smile and changed.\r\n\r\n&hellip;Let&rsquo;s try to survive first.\r\n[hr]&ldquo;What can I do for my elder brother?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Well.&rdquo;\r\n[hr]Pale sky blue hair fluttered finely in the wind. He smiled weakly, before parting his dry lips.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Call my name.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;...&rdquo;\r\n\r\nMy head quickly snapped up.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Call me&hellip; Amoru.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nHis fingertips skimmed along my inner wrist.\r\n[hr][i]Note: This is a oneshot promotional manhwa for the novel of the same name.[/i]",
