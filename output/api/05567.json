But will it really turn out that way...?\r\n\r\n- I Miss\r\nAfter one of Ninomiya Majyu's girl friend declines to go to a live concert with her due to certain circumstances,\r\nMakyu's new guy friend Aoi Kou asks if he can go with Majyu instead.

But what's this? Mai might have more then just sisterly feelings for her brother?\r\nAnd why is Majyu's heart starting to hurt so much when she sees them together, when she shouldn't care in the first place?\r\nAn uncomplicated story about jealousy, obsession, forbidden love, and a little courage about ones feelings.\r\n\r\n- Line Heart\r\nMafuyu has always looked after Yuna, even now when they're both in high school.
