In order to not repeat the miserable life, Ariel decides to have a contractual marriage with the son of the grand duke, Lakatyer, who is famous for blood and madness.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Good, Ariel. Now you are the Lady of this house.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;But I just married yesterday&hellip;&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;The Grand Duchess is not here so you are the Lady of this house.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAriel responds, clenching her fists, &ldquo;I will do my best.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t need to do your best. The house is all yours. So just think of how to enjoy it.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nWhy is everyone so nice to me?\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Speaking of which, what are all these keys?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper glanced at the keys and laughed.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;These keys are for the treasury of the grand duke&rsquo;s family.&rdquo; Yeah? What do you&hellip;?\r\n\r\n&lsquo;He said that I can use all of them as I please because there are all mine?&rsquo;\r\n\r\nAriel just barely understood the situation barely and surprised. Wait&hellip; it means he left all his treasures to me even though I&rsquo;m just ten years old? She was confused, why does she have the repository keys of this house?
