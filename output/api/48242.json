I&rsquo;m standing next to the man who once killed me.\r\n\r\nThat night was the &ldquo;Star Festival,&rdquo; a celebration for the founding of the proud kingdom of Hyland. Blinded by love, Queen Alicia had turned her back on the people of the country. She was then killed from a stab in the chest by a man who marched into the castle&hellip; Or at least, that was what should have happened. When she woke up, Alicia found herself ten years old again. Holding the memory of her murder, she was given a chance to redo her life.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this, she reunites with Clovis, the man who once killed her&hellip;?!\r\n\r\nThis is the story of the Blue Rose Princess who will &quot;redo&quot; her life, and her future that is tossed around by the mischief of fate!",
