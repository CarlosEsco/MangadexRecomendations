  "description": "Next to impossible coincidences seem to be connected to a shared dream&hellip; Is this destiny?\r\nChayee springs out of bed after one of the most realistic and steamy dreams she&rsquo;s ever had. After bringing herself back to reality, she goes to work as a T.A. at her former university. But, while on an errand for her professor, she meets Dohun and gets the shock of her life. He&hellip; seriously resembles the man she spent a hot night in the dream. She finds herself unable to face him since every glance brings back the very realistic feelings of the night before!\r\n&ldquo;By any chance, have we&hellip; met before?&rdquo;\r\nDohun also has unexplainable feelings of discomfort towards Chayee and puts as much space between them as he can. But, no matter how hard they try, fate keeps dragging them back towards each other. What&rsquo;s going on?! When dreams and reality intertwine, anything can happen![hr]Raw: [url=https://page.kakao.com/home/55728770]KakaoPage[/url], [url=https://ridibooks.com/books/1180010765]Ridibooks[/url], [url=https://www.lezhin.com/ko/comic/survival_marriage]Lezhin[/url]\r\nOfficial English: [url=https://www.netcomics.com/comic/312]NetComics[/url], [url=https://www.tappytoon.com/en/comics/survival-marriage]Tappytoon[/url], [url=https://www.comico.io/pocket-comics]Pocket Comics[/url]",
