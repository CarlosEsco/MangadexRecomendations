  "description": "The first in Leiji Matsumoto's line of Space Opera works. Originally created as a companion piece to the Space Battleship Yamato Anime (also called a &quot;Manga Movie&quot; at the time by Matsumoto and other staff) which Matsumoto was also directing at the time. \r\n\r\n In the year 2199 humanity has found itself in a losing battle against a ruthless alien species known as the Gamilans. Forced to live underground after constant bombardment and irreparable damage done to the surface, humanity lives constantly on the defensive, every victory a pyrrhic one. Suddenly, Earth receives a transmission from the Queen of the planet Iscandar who offers humanity a device that can restore the Earth to the verdant image it once possessed. \r\n\r\n Using the schematics detailed in the transmission, Earth retrofits an old warship, the Yamato, now suited for space travel and Earth's last ditch effort. With a ragtag crew and one heckuva determined captain, they set out for Iscandar hoping to acquire the device that will make Earth, Earth once again. Their maiden voyage does not go unnoticed, however, and Fuhrer Dessler, the worshipped leader of the Gamilans, seeks to interrupt their trip at sea. \r\n\r\n Dealing with hostile forces, a short staffed crew, and various technical complications, the Yamato and its crew must brave the dangers and the treachery if Earth is to live to see another day.\r\n\r\nPlease support the official release.
