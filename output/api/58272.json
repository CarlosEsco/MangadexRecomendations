  "description": "One lives a carefree lifestyle roaming around the world. The other places his reason over his heart, after weathering thousands of hardships. Their relationship, which simply began as &ldquo;having fun while it lasts&rdquo;, gradually evolves into a bloodless psychological battle. While suspicion and mutual intrigue escalate into warfare as they relentlessly challenge each other&rsquo;s bottom-line, their emotions unknowingly build until they are helplessly entangled together. The one who cares more is also the one who is more affected by the presence of the other.",
