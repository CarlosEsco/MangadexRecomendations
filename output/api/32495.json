  "description": "Pompo: The Cin&eacute;phile depicts the craft of movie-making and revolves around Joelle Davidovich &quot;Pompo&quot; Pomponette, a talented movie producer who looks like a girl.\r\n\r\nOperating out of the movie capital &quot;Nyallywood,&quot; Pompo has been shooting one B-grade entertainment flick after another that anyone would enjoy. One day, Pompo's &quot;movie buff&quot; assistant Gene spots a new script written by Pompo and is moved by its exquisite story. In a fit of passion, he proclaims, &quot;I want to see this as a finished work in theaters as soon as possible!&quot;\r\n\r\n However, Pompo tells him, &quot;So you shoot this film.&quot; Thus, Gene takes on his first directing gig. Meanwhile, Natalie, an ordinary girl who just arrived in town with movie actress dreams, has been discovered by Pompo.\r\n\r\n[*][u]Nominated for the 11th Manga Taishou Awards in 2018.[/u]",
