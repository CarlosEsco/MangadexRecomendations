  "description": "Athanasia Cloix, a woman whose elegance and beauty is akin to that of a swan lake, was the Duke&rsquo;s eldest daughter and the Queen of the social circles: an existence near to perfection. Due to some rumors, however, people began to misunderstand and belittle her. As she suffered through these unfortunate events, she learned to conceal her feelings by putting on a fa&ccedil;ade and agreed to a political marriage with the Winter-comer who's also known as the &ldquo;Northern Monster.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&quot;As the Grand Duke, I will do my best to accommodate your needs and desires. But love alone is something I can't give to you.&quot; Unbeknownst to her, that very man will change her life and thus a new fate is about to unfold.\r\n\r\n[i]Note: Original novel by Nunoiz is Korean, but the comic is drawn by a Chinese artist. It was first released in Chinese and then released in Korean.[/i]\r\n[hr][b][u]Links:[/u][/b]\r\n[*][url=https://twitter.com/xiluoyue]Artist's Twitter[/url]\r\n[*][url=https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=50467381]Original Novel[/url]\r\n[*][url=https://piccoma.com/web/product/32421]Official Japanese Translation[/url]\r\n[*][url=https://page.kakao.com/home/%EC%95%85%EB%85%80%EB%8A%94-%EB%B3%80%ED%99%94%ED%95%9C%EB%8B%A4/53903018]Official Korean Translation[/url]",
