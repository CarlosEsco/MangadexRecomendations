  "description": "Mishima is your average spineless pushover, working as a repairman for the Exopolis Tower, Tokyo's largest and hottest highrise business and entertainment building. He promised to come home in time to celebrate his son's birthday, but when he lets his pushy boss saddle him with overtime, the task takes him all night. On the morning subway train heading home, a massive earthquake strikes and collapses both Exopolis and its underground train lines. Now Mishima is trapped deep underground with the other passengers of the train, some of whom are less than cooperative. Will he be able to take the initiative for once and lead them all to freedom, or will they starve in their underground prison?",
