  "description": "Hina, a Japanese foreign student. Junho, sufferer of Elite OCD. Won, a girl with her own way of seeing the world. A campus life story of these three people. Deals with the issues of Japanese, Korean and global society.\r\n\r\nThe author, Yellow Goo Mi, was born in Japan, but since her parents are Korean, the Japanese government will not give her a Japanese citizenship (which is considered a problem in some aspects; these people are slightly alienated by the 'real' Japanese people in society, despite their extremely Japanese upbringing). As a person with a Japanese and Korean heritage, she writes about the problems in modern Japanese and Korean society, plus the global society in more recent chapters.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the webtoon focuses on Hina and the Japanese society, an example being the more increasing problems with Japanese bullying (ijimae).\r\nThe second part of the webtoon focuses on Jun Ho and the Korean society, an example being the flaws of Korean education system. Currently, the webtoon now focuses on the global society.",
