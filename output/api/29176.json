  "description": "Mary Albert, the daughter of the prominent noble Albert house, remembers that this world is an otome game she played in her past life. And she is the game protagonist... Er, the protagonist's enemy, the typical noble villainess who bullies the protagonist. \r\n\r\nIf matters proceed like that in the game, her family will fall into ruin and she herself will be incarcerated in the northernmost ends. &quot;I will not accept a life like that!&quot; She makes up her mind to avoid her ruin\u2015\u2015Or NOT?! \r\n\r\n'On the contrary, I will take the Ruin Course, and the one to have the last laugh won't be me! Together with my sarcastic attendant, I will aim for ruin!'\r\n[hr][b]Links:[/b]\r\n[*][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_jwZ6yNjSE]Voiced Comic Adaptation[/url]\r\n[*][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqe3KftFeog&amp;t=1s]Voiced Comic Adaptation (With Commentary)[/url]",
