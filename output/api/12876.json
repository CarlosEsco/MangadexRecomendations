The intended recipient is a mystery, but the writer&rsquo;s identity is clear: a fellow student who&rsquo;s suddenly leaving Tokyo and heading back to his hometown. Hirose is determined to return the letter, and as he tries to do so he runs into a black-market match seller, Seiji Hanashiro. Drawn to each other at first sight, tangled up in destiny and their own feelings, the men see their lives turned upside down by a single love letter. The first volume of Sakae Kusama&rsquo;s standalone series, Lost Letters.",
