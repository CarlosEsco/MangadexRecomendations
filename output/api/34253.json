  "description": "Leo's on his first romantic hot springs trip! He doesn't care if they're in public &ndash; all he wants to do is act lovey-dovey with his boyfriend. However, because it's a relationship between men, his partner, who's obsessed with appearances, rejects him at every turn. While taking a walk, Leo finds himself being ogled by a handsome man named Ryouta. After his boyfriend refuses to be physically intimate, Leo escapes from his room, only to run into the hunky Ryouta again.\r\n\r\nHoping to get some action, Ryouta claims to be checking on Leo's wellbeing to try and seduce him, smirking all the while! Under a superficial layer of kindness, Ryouta appears to have a bad personality. Leo, who can't resist anything that feels good, is going to do what with Ryouta&hellip;?!",
