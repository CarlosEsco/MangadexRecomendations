However, before Yuuya could teach at the school, he first must find a card called Genesis Omega Dragon that said will determine the fate of the world that also connected to his scattered memories.\r\n\r\nThe story is set in alternate version of Miami City where Leo Corporation, run by its president Reiji Akaba, dominates most of Solid Vision system throughout the city. The spread of the company's Solid Vision with mass not only gave birth to &quot;Action Duels&quot; but also help improving the city in saving lives and repair damage in case of disaster, becoming a vital part of people's life.",
