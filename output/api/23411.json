  "description": "Momosato only dreams to live a normal high school girl life. Which means, find perfect love with another high schooler. \r\nBut poor Momosato seems to be victim of a curse : each time she finds love, that one will find it too but with another girl. That's why her comrades consider her as their Cupidon against her own will.",
