  "description": "Sayoko Bizen is a buxom, cynical, shrewdly intelligent, and sexually uninhibited loner trying to move up in the world. Sayoko quits her executive secretary job after her boss fails to seduce her, and she exposes his affair with a co-worker. By chance, she meets a meek and outwardly unimpressive young man named Satoru Ichi (actual name: Yuichi Tsugaru), a virgin whom she initially tries to scam by coming to his apartment as a massage girl, who Satoru mistakenly believes is a call girl.",
