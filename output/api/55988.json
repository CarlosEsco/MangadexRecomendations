Or is there something more to Yoshito's long time friendship with cameraman Ooshiro?\r\n\r\n2-4) Cameraman Ooshiro Yutaka's heart has just been broken. Shortly afterwards, he encounters actor Itou Naoya. He's attracted to his image of a naked innocence and the role that the gap in front of the camera plays. He begins to approach that gap, but when it's time to take pictures for a commercial campaign, Ooshiro finds kiss marks all over Nao's body. Bothered by his feelings of betrayal, Ooshiro realizes for the first time his deep feelings for Nao. But where does he go from here?\r\n\r\n5) Happy Box\r\nEvery day, a mysterious gorgeous guy comes to the store where Shouhei works and buys a single bento box. In order to get to know him better, Shouhei makes some excuse about being a chef in training and offers the mysterious guy his handmade bento boxes...\r\n\r\n6) Naoya and Ooshiro extra",
