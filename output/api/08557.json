  "description": "In the world of Kabuki, where family social standings are highly valued, Kyonosuke is inept even though he is born as the son of a duke of a famous household. Ichiya while being born in a family that has no connection to Kabuki, is trying to move from the absolute lowest rank to the top using just his ability. Through some kind of karma, these two completely opposite boys have fallen in love with the same girl, Ayame.\r\n\r\nThat&rsquo;s where the story begins.\r\n\r\nPin to Kona won the 57th Shogakukan Manga Awards.",
