  "description": "Shoko has turned 30 and she has finally given up on finding a marriage partner. Recently having completed a year long contract, she wants to explore the freedom her lack of relationship and job obligations afford her and books a trip to Seoul, Korea. Unencumbered, she wants to visit the Korean BBQ restaurants alone and drink to celebrate her &quot;graduation from marriage seeking activities.&quot;\r\n\r\nNot quite supportive is her sister, one who is already married to a good-looking, high earning man, who thinks Shoko should do the responsible thing and give marriage hunting a shot again. But Shoko cannot be deterred. \r\n\r\nBut life has a strange way of turning things around. On her trip to Seoul, Shoko makes a surprising discovery, and an unexpected connection...\r\n\r\nThis is a collaborative project between Higashimura Akiko and NAVER webtoon, which may be the first of its kind, at least involving such a luminary figure in manga. It is being released in Korean and Japanese, but not quite simul-release. Korean is about 20 chapters ahead.\r\n\r\nGisou Furin is now a live-action JDrama! The setting is changed slightly, as the trip is to Hakata in Fukuoka, not Seoul, Korea and the love interest is a returnee who had moved to Spain as a kid and not a Korean. Most unfortunately, there is no Bump-chan. Boo. The first episode covers almost to chapter 12.  There are subtitled 1080p episodes available at usual sources. Try it!",
