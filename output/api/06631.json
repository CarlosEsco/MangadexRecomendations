  "description": "Yoshotoshi Heion was a 1st year high school student who had no desire to excel--and liked it that way. In fact he chose Hiyotani High school for that reason. It was an average school only 5 minutes from his house. There's even a cute girl in his class, Rina Fujimoto, and he's already given up on her. But Rina wants to join the &quot;Wind Orchestra Club&quot; (Brass Band Club) only to learn it's been disbanded. Rina's passion for music inspires Yoshotoshi to help revive the club. &quot;Once you make the first step... Who knows what will happen?&quot;",
