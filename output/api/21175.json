  "description": "Bo-eun has recently acquired a furry little roommate named Dallae (Korean for azalea), who she met in an azalea field. Dallae has her own schedule, though, and comes and goes as she pleases. Meanwhile, Bo-eun can&rsquo;t seem to stop dreaming about a missed friendship in high school &ndash; her name is Saeyeon. Oddly enough, it was around the time that Dallae started showing up that Bo-eun started having recurring dreams of Saeyeon...\r\n\r\nThis story has two (or is it three?) main characters, and they&rsquo;re all hiding a secret from each other.",
