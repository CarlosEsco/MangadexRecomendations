Kuramoto Soutaro, the heir to the wealthy Kuramoto family, has returned from living overseas to the country of his childhood, wishing desperately to reconcile with his adored yet estranged childhood friend, Asuma Haruomi, the heir to a family of onnagata in the pleasure district of Tokyo, who has grown into a dancer of beauty and reknown during the years of their separation.
