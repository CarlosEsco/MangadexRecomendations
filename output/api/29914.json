  "description": "In a deserted alley travelled by few, is an antique shop. It has no sign, no name. It sells the usual items, but if you believe the rumors, this particular shop also sells undisclosed wish-granting items - for a price, of course. And buyers who fail to follow an item's directions for use will pay an especially high price.",
