  "description": "The villain was reincarnated as an extra in a novel where all the soul was sucked to death. What would you do if you were reborn at best? 18 years of living as a slave after being mistreated by his family. Just as the original did, the parents succeeded in running away, just before they were forcibly sold to the villain. Also, I had a small but happy time with Momo, an organic dog I met in a rural village. But three months later, the dog that took care of his pampering disappeared! They are caught by their families and are dedicated to villains. The moment I was discouraged that I had a rusting death, &ldquo;Why are you so surprised? It's me, your puppy Momo.&rdquo;\r\n[hr][b][u]T&uuml;rk&ccedil;e / Turkish[/u][/b]\r\n[spoiler]B&uuml;t&uuml;n ruhlar\u0131n emildi\u011fi ve yok edildi\u011fi bir romanda k&ouml;t&uuml; adam yeniden do\u011fdu.
