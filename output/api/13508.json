  "description": "Nozaki Haruka's family moves to a small town following her father's new job. Unfortunately, Haruka becomes a target of bullying in the new school, which is set to close in a few months due to the lack of students. As a strong girl, who doesn't want to worry her parent, Haruka tries to ignore the bullies, but the case is steadily growing out of proportion. And since the teachers are not willing to deal with bullying during the final school months, nothing is stopping an appalling tragedy that is looming over Haruka.",
