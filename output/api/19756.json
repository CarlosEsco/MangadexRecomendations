  "description": "Rafita is the young, rising star of the bullfighting world known as &quot;The Red Matador.&quot; He has never feared facing a bull since his first kill at the age of twelve. But when he falls in love with Mauro, a butcher who rends the bulls that Rafita kills, his confidence begins to waver. In the matador's dreams, Mauro (who, like a bull, is colorblind) is alternately the bull he faces in the ring and the butcher who carves up his own skewered corpse.",
