  "description": "[b]Promo for the novel.[/b]\r\n\r\nShe believed he was a heartless husband and treated him badly. Until he was hunted down as a traitor in order to protect her.\r\n\r\n&lsquo;My wife. Please be in good health.&rsquo;\r\n\r\nHer heart was torn to pieces as she knelt before his severed arm. Even now. But this time she could see that his body was clearly intact.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Your highness? Why are you crying all of a sudden?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nShe had returned after losing hope. To the first night of their wedding three years ago.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You must be nervous about your first night. Don&rsquo;t worry. I didn&rsquo;t plan to spend the night with your highness anyways.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Why? I&rsquo;m your bride and the wedding is over. Now, let&rsquo;s take off our clothes and go to bed.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;&hellip;Your highness?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nShe tugged at his arm with force.\r\n\r\n'I&rsquo;m not leaving you this time. I will protect you for sure, and I&rsquo;ll die with you if I fail to do so. Not as Nirisu&rsquo;s princess but your wife, Agnes Alfred,' she pledged with determination.",
