  "description": "The series takes place six months after the end of GDW:O. The dogs have been at peace, and all has seemingly gone well. However soon the monsterous bear Monsoon attacks, wanting to claim Futago Pass as his own. All the while getting vengeance for his father- Akakabuto who was killed by Gin during the events of GNG.\r\n\r\nVictory is not assured for the dogs, as an aging Gin has developed cataracts in his eyes, and the leader Weed is critically injured by one of Monsoon's kin. Weed's children have been sent away for training, and are oblivious to the crisis at hand.\r\n\r\nCan the soldiers of Ohu defeat this new take on an old threat? Or is this truly be to their last fight?",
