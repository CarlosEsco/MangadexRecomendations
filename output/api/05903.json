  "description": "Misono Kazuki is a college student pursuing a dream of becoming a famous novelist&mdash;but unfortunately, for someone trying to pen a supernatural YA novel, he&rsquo;s got next to no experience with close encounters of the spiritual kind. To remedy this, at the suggestion of a friend, he heads to a supposedly haunted shrine late one moonlit evening, and while he doesn&rsquo;t find any ghosts, he does find something much more interesting.",
