  "description": "The Cosmos is ruled by a holy queen who guides and watches over the movement of the stars. By balancing elemental forces with the help of nine Guardians, she keeps the planets stable and the people content...However, the power of the queen is fading and a new queen must be appointed.\r\n\r\nTwo girls are selected to be the queen candidates: Rosalia de Catargena who comes from a noble family in one of the main domains and the main character, Angelique Limoges, a seemingly ordinary girl.\r\n\r\nWill Angelique become the holy queen? Or will she fall in love with one of the many handsome Guardians and forfeit her candidacy?\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nAngelique follows the story of two candidates to become the ruler of the cosmos. One is very regal and well trained to rule the cosmos. The other, our protagonist, is a wild card with little experience but more heart. Both set out as part of their tests to grow and nurture their own private worlds. Each receives assistance by nine guardians (all male) who use their abilities, known as Sacrea, to help the candidates manage their worlds. The stories revolve around the friendships with our heroine, the guardians, her rival for candidacy, the queen's aide and a few of the citizens of her own world. The second part of the story deals with how the heroine grows and learns from her own mistakes while running her own world on her own quest to become queen of the cosmos.\r\n\r\nAnimeNewsNetwork Links:\r\n[url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2310]Shiroi Tsubasa no Memoir[/url] (OAV)\r\n[url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=4470]Seichi Yori Ai o Komete[/url] (OAV, sequel)\r\n[url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=4469]Twin Collection[/url] (OAV, sequel)\r\n\r\n[url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=4468]OAV[/url] (prequel)\r\n[url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6675]Kokoro no Mezameru Toki[/url] (spinoff)\r\n[url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6865]Kagayaki no Ashita[/url] (sequel)",
