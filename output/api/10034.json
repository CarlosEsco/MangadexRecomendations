  "description": "Nishimoto Haruki is a 21 year old male and a newly recruited police officer. However, all his past assignments involved him dressing up as a girl in order to solve the crime. It seems that he has the feminine features that make him the only one suitable for the position. However, things get even crazier when he is assigned to be in the all female police squad surrounded by gorgeous women. He has to protect his secret that he's actually a man but Haruki is already having a hard time controlling his urges.",
