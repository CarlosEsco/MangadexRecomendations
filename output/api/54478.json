  "description": "I&rsquo;m Selena, a daughter born to a family well-known for their fertile women. I was all but sold off in a marriage to a sickly duke whose life hung in the balance, all for the sake of producing an heir for his family. They provided me a medicine purported to aid in pregnancy, and the astrologist advised me good days for sleeping together,  but... there was no child.\r\n&ldquo;So, are there any signs of pregnancy?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Ah, I-I'm sorry.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re useless. What luck do you think won you the position of the duke's wife?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nI couldn't say a word.\r\n\r\n&lsquo;No, excuse me. I only have to look at the sky to pluck a star. That's how I attained this position.&rsquo; *\r\n\r\n[(metaphor) Lit. Plucking a star from the sky: something that's difficult to get/achieve)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nA husband who doesn&rsquo;t like touching me in the least.\r\n\r\nBut he's still pitiful so let's at least make him healthy by feeding him nutritious food, getting him to exercise, and I&rsquo;ll taste test any doubtful food first personally. Once he recovers from my extensive efforts, I&rsquo;ll sign an annulment paper and flee, but...\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You agreed to a contract to bear me an heir. But to think you would go back on your words...&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAlthough he&rsquo;s in good health now, my &ldquo;former&rdquo; husband has become a bit too healthy.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You're healthy now!&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;The duties of marriage are sacred. I will collect my dues.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Wait. Wait! But we&rsquo;re divorced? We&rsquo;re no longer husband and wife...&rdquo;\r\n\r\nHe smirked then took a piece of paper from his breast pocket and tossed it to me.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We aren't divorced yet.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nHuh?!\r\n[hr][i]Note: This is a oneshot promotional manhwa for the novel of the same name [/i]",
