  "description": "I'm a renowned genius in the History Department of my college, but I can't believe that I've travelled back in time into the body of a princess whose country was defeated in war! Was my being a genius in history all for nothing?! And not only am I stuck in the past, I'm having an arranged marriage with the Westerners as well! Moreover, I'm being married off to a country that runs of magic and has severe gender inequality issues. But don't you dare underestimate me! You're looking down on me, a princess of a defeated country? Well, I'll show you who's the real expert here!",
