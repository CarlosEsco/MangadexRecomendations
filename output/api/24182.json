She gets fed up with a bothersome customer and ends up taking matters into her own hands. Her higher up, the Bunny Leader, is not pleased with this. So the Bunny Leader decides it's time to re-train this wayward rabbit....\r\n\r\n- [i]Bunny's Road Part 2[/i] Kurahashi the Bunny Girl, (with very bad luck), finally has a newcomer to bully. But can Kurahashi actually bring herself to torment the perfect Miyamae--or will she end up being &ldquo;trained&rdquo; yet again?\r\n\r\n- [i]Bunny's Road Part 3[/i] Kurahashi the Bunny Girl, will she have a happy ending? \r\n\r\n- [i]31 Degrees Celsius[/i] (yuri): A surprisingly upbeat story about two girls contemplating suicide.\r\n\r\nLink:\r\n[url=https://www.doujinshi.org/book/166138/Amai-Kuchibiru/]The Doujinshi &amp; Manga Lexicon[/url]",
