  "description": "Meet Min Woo. A normal 18 year-old high school boy. Well... normal except for being a total otaku. He does what every good little otaku boy does. He collects figurines and toys, wins prizes at cosplay contests and is a two-time champion of the fighting game &quot;Metal Heart&quot;. Unfortunately for him, his social life is dominated by girls telling him to get lost, since his otaku-ness might be contagious.\r\nBut after an accident while he is invited to participate in the playtesting of &quot;Metal Heart 2&quot;, the main character to the game, Min Sia, materializes in front of his eyes at a cosplay festival. And now, Min Woo has to win Sia's heart in a real-life dating sim game with the fate of the world in the balance. Ok, so maybe not the world, but at least the fate of the company behind &quot;Metal Heart 2&quot; hanging in the balance.\r\nAnd who is this girl, Nuri, who appears to be following Sia and claims to be Min Woo's childhood friend...?",
