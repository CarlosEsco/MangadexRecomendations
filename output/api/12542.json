Supporting these heroes are the human defense forces, of which the sisters Yuri and Miyuki Kitajishi are a part. Specifically, their office is for hero consultation, and they help heroes solve their problems, but they also help evacuation procedures during emergencies.

In their first case, they consult with a hero who has lost his powers, and is trying to find a way to live as an ordinary human.",
