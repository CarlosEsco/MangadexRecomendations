  "description": "&quot;-You can see the disgusting face of the Buddha's face on you. It has a face that seems insensitive.&quot; He was a vengeful young man of &quot;Nogigumi&quot; and had a strong revenge for the older brother, Karasuba Itsutsu, who betrayed himself in the past. Several years after the day of farewell-Ginza calls Ichitetsu and orders his subordinates to &quot;make this a woman.&quot; It should have been the most effective way to crush Ichitetsu's mentor, who is not afraid of some pain. However, for some reason, Ichitetsu, who is non-resistive and can endure pleasure blame, is evoked by Gibai's obscene inferiority and obsession.",
