  "description": "&quot;Garden&quot; is a collection of Furuya Usamaru's &ldquo;indie&rdquo; shorts that were published in Comic Cue, Manga Erotics and GARO respectively. The title is obviously a reference to Hieronymus Bosch&rsquo;s famous triptych The Garden of Earthly Delights, with the first story being a homage to said painting. The other stories range from absurd comedies to fantasy to horror. It&rsquo;s a very eclectic mixture, but make no mistake: artistically, Garden might just be Furuya&rsquo;s most accomplished work after The Music of Marie.",
