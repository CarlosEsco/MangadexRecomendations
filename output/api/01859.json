  "description": "Yuri, a modern day teenager who had just received her first kiss, is suddenly whisked away to ancient Anatolia where an evil queen wants her for a blood sacrifice. Luckily, the timely intervention of Prince Kail saves Yuri from the queen's grasp. For now. Kail promises to send Yuri back to her home, but the queen's persistent schemes to kill them both, plus their growing interest in each other, keep those plans delayed.\r\n\r\nNote: Contains a side story called Orontes\r\nRenka that is published in the final volume (28) of Anatolia Story, which is set in the same historic period.\r\n\r\nOrontes Renka:\r\nMany years after the end of Yuri's reign... the Hittite empire is about to become an Egyptian territory through marriage between the Hittite princess and the Egyptian king. A traveler from Egypt, Maripas, comes to the land of the Hittites at this time and gets robbed of all his belongings while playing good samaritan. He's then offered shelter by an unusually well-educated Hittite girl named Yuri. But this seemingly innocent meeting soon turns into a thrilling romantic adventure -- cases of mistaken identity and runaway royals are about to complicate international relations!\r\n\r\n(Datenshi Blue's vol 28 does not include Orontes Renka. Instead, it was released separately by ShoujoMagic.)\r\n\r\nIn 2001 this series won the Shogakukan Manga Award for sh\u014djo.",
