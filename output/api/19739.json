  "description": "Young scientists, Raul and Olivier De Laune, are researching the potential of genetic modification and cloning, set against the backdrop of the early 1930s. At a University talk on their research, Raul is accused by a clairvoyant, who tells him he can only clone someone successfully if their soul is transferred also. That night, Olivier is found murdered with no trace of injury or method of death. The clairvoyant tells Raul Olivier&rsquo;s soul was ripped from his body by some non-human creature. She shows Raul a vision of Olivier, who tells him to find the &lsquo;Blaise twins&rsquo;. Soon after, larger than life, soul eating wolves begin to appear in the city, killing people by taking their souls. Raul is falsely accused of initiating the wolves and is forced to go on the run from the police. Now its up to Raul, his research assistant, a clairvoyant, two flunky private detectives and a retired chief of police to clear his name, find the Blaise twins, find the cause of the wolves, and most of all, put a stop to them.",
