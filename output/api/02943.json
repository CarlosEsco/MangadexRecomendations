  "description": "Takeuchi Sachiko's Honey &amp; Honey is a realistic look at an adult lesbian couple living in Japan; to be precise, it's autobiographical. The artwork is rough, but hopefully the plot (and the information the manga imparts) will be enough compensation for those who don't like that style of drawing. The first chapter introduces the two main characters, Sachiko and Masako, and depicts their first meeting.",
