  "description": "1-3:\r\nThey'd been drunk. Or, more specifically, his boss had been drunk. So when Sakamoto jumped him, Kurahashi just went along with it. After all, it was just the alcohol...right?\r\n\r\nWrong! At least, that's what his boss thinks...and said boss doesn't have a problem trying out a relationship with a colleague he thinks is in love with him. Unable to gainsay him, Kurahashi gets dragged into a relationship he never asked for &ndash; and finds himself getting deeper than he ever imagined.\r\n\r\n4:\r\nTwo childhood friends who abruptly drifted apart years ago are reunited. One of them is now a Buddhist monk... What does his friend feel about this?\r\n\r\n5:\r\nThe shy, reclusive, bespectacled Egawa confessed to Aoki on high-school graduation day...and was politely turned down. The two unexpectedly reunite in university, but to Aoki's surprise, Egawa has become a completely different person who's very popular with the ladies! But why does this cause strange, conflicting emotions within Aoki?",
