  "description": "MAD WANG 1160 takes place in the year Universal Century 1160, some 1072 years after the events of the Kyouka Ningen Monogatari - Another Z Gundam Story. The three main characters, Shiva Yips, Decoder S. Wallenstein and Mell Mekanika awake from cold sleep (cryonics) in each of their colonies and are swallowed up in the Earth vs. the Outer Space Alliance's battle. \r\n\r\nThe story is set in the distant future of the Universal Century timeline, departing from the normal setting of Gundam. It should be noted that the term &quot;Gundam&quot; is not utilized in this work, and it is one of the first UC works to implement nanotechnology in the story, which was also used &forall; Gundam.",
