  "description": "1) Mitsu no Yoru\r\nThe younger brother, Yakou, attracts and embraces me. He is so special to me, but this sin is too heavy for me to bear. However, maybe it will worth it if Yakou can play and do as he pleases with me?\r\n\r\n2) Boku no Pink\r\nShe lost her parents when she was 10 years old. Since then, she's dreamt of having her own family, even if that family is temporary...\r\n\r\n3) Kanojo no Himitsu XXX\r\nThe main character is always mistaken for a ko-gal due to her natural blond hair, but in truth, she's just a turtle-loving gal! The only one that noticed was her handsome (duh!) student council president. As she joins the student council for you-know-what reason, will the president just misunderstand her as many others do?\r\n\r\n4) Ichioku no Koi\r\nMy price is worth 100 million? Money is in exchange of Love? It is a super love story\r\n\r\n5) Kimete Agemasu ~Mamotte Agemasu Bangai Hen~\r\nOnizuka doesn't want to be &quot;a good person&quot; in Kotome's eyes any longer and is determined to buy THAT. (A side story based on the Agemasu series by the same author.)",
