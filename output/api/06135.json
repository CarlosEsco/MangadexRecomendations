  "description": "After the death of Mao's mother, who was called the &quot;Fairy of Cuisine&quot;, Mao must strive to become a legendary chef himself, in order to take the title as head chef at his mother's restaurant. To do this, he must travel across China to learn the many ways of cooking. During his journey, he meets great friends and also fierce rivals.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Ch\u016bka Ichiban![/b] (\u4e2d\u83ef\u4e00\u756a!, lit. Chinese Food Number One!) is a manga created by Ogawa Etsushi.\r\nFrom 1995-1997 it was published as Ch\u016bka Ichiban!. However, during the middle of its serialization, the character '\u771f' was added, so from 1997 to 1999, it was serialized as [b]Shin Ch\u016bka Ichiban![/b] (\u771f\u30fb\u4e2d\u83ef\u4e00\u756a!, Truth - China's Number One!).\r\nIn 1997, Ch\u016bka Ichiban! was adapted into an anime series directed by Anno Masami of the same name. In some countries, the anime adaptation was called [b]Cooking Master Boy[/b].\r\n\r\nOgawa Etsushi's debut oneshot, [b]King of Tower[/b], is included as an extra in volume four.",
