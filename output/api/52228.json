  "description": "After being sold to slave traders, Mirelys had no will to live on anymore...until her mana leaked out and caused an explosion in the building. An imagery of a mirror from her house shattered, that's when all her past life memories flooded into her. Mirelys Arjurine was a villainess in a book, and was also ruthlessly killed by the main protagonist, Duke Allen Chastein. \r\n\r\nThe Emperor of Emeriyal arrived at the scene only to see a ragged girl with hollow eyes. \r\n\r\n&quot;Papa, I want that thing.&quot; A boy with smooth, jet black hair pointed his finger at Mirelys.\r\n\r\nWith no hesitation, the emperor agreed to his son's request and brought home a castaway. Will Mirelys ever attain a true family bond she never had in her life, or does she have different intentions...?",
