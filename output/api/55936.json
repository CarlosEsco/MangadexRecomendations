  "description": "People cannot lie. In a world where humans fully trust each other, the existence of people who can lie is merely a myth, a figment of fiction. Saegye is a dare, a person who can tell both truths and lies; he cheats and deceives for his own gain. However, Lee Jinsol steps on his tail, and proposes an offer Saegye can&rsquo;t refuse. Three days later he started telling Saegye he loves him.",
