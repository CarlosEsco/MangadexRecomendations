  "description": "This collection of three stories by Akino Kondoh presents some of the cartoonist and animator's best known work for Ax, Japan's premier venue for alternative manga, and a recent story about life in New York City.\r\n\r\nQuiet stories of contemplation, mixed with the surreal strangeness just beyond conscious thought: pushing events into the background until you forget what they were, a girl feeling a strange presence as she goes to sleep, and losing part of yourself in preparing for someone's return.",
