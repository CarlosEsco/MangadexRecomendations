  "description": "The year is 2014, a new substance, SDE01, commonly referred to as &quot;Mana&quot; is discovered by a group of Russian scientists. The world plunges into a development race to find uses of this new seemingly unlimited source of energy that cannot be seen or felt.\r\n\r\n16 years after the discovery, it's now the self-proclaimed Age of Magic, where you can download an App to your very phone and cast magic. However, heavy restrictions have been imposed over the available spells, and the required paperwork to even use a high level spell are astronomic.\r\n\r\nAmong the citizens of this new world, a red robed mysterious man seems capable of wielding extremely powerful magic in a way that should not be possible. It's unknown what his aim is or what he wants to accomplish. All that's known about this mysterious person is that he has been using forbidden level spells to kill evil-doers throughout the city.\r\n\r\nBut detective Kim is in charge of catching this murderer/hero. And he doesn't plan on giving up.",
