  "description": "Three students are living fairly normal lives when, one day, they are overcome with intense stomach pain and a star symbol appears like a tattoo on their skin. With the symbol came supernatural powers, as well as enemies coming to kill them.\r\n\r\nAs more and more people develop similar supernatural powers, the story starts to turn into a Battle Royalesque bloody playground, only with an entire city as the setting and many innocents caught in the crossfire.\r\n\r\nAmong other themes, the story asks the question, &quot;When is it alright to kill?&quot; and delves deep into the darkness of the human psyche.",
