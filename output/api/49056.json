  "description": "&quot;I&quot; had the luck of being the one who reached out towards the young lady whose engagement was annulled by Prince Alephaldo, Elana. The day after the annulment, I was banished with her and married even though we dated for exactly 0 days. Well, it's just a slow country lifestyle of banishment in the neighboring country! Or so I thought, but...? This is my story about becoming a banished villainess's husband.\r\n[hr][url=https://twitter.com/NtsmKimama]Manga artist's twitter[/url]\r\n[url=https://twitter.com/yukixkana]LN artist's twitter[/url]",
