Years later in high school, Tomoya makes a sudden return, but now Keito's no longer a cute little kid Tomoya seems to have forgotten who he is!\r\n\r\n2. Masaka no Futari\r\nHigh-school student Akito is too cute! So cute that he's been traumatized by attackers both male and female. When Akito's mother convinces laid back college student Kunugi to tutor him, is Akito destined to be attacked again? Or is Kunugi really just a nice guy?\r\n\r\n3. Lucky Item\r\nYazawa Shizuma, receives a visit one night from a middle school classmate, Hanai. Hanai is running from debt collectors and needs someone to take care of his son, Hanai Souta. What will happen between these two? Maizuru from Yubisaki no Koi makes a guest appearance in this story.\r\n\r\n4. Hitomi no Ori\r\nWhen he was small, Ran was found at the brink of death by Byakuroku-sama, a non-human man with beautiful eyes.

Hitomi dj - Sakayume no Niwa\r\nRan has a dream in which Byakuroku vanishes into thin air and only bones remain. Even knowing it was a dream, he can't just help being worried. Will the dream become reality...?\r\n\r\n[u][b]Polish / Polski:[/b][/u] \r\nZbi&oacute;r oneshot&oacute;w.",
