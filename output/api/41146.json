  "description": "One-shot about an ordinary Japanese man who decides to tell his parents he's gay, and the family drama that follows. An interesting (short) look inside the Japanese closet, where many stereotypes, social prejudices, and pressure to keep up appearances and be what others expect you to be still weigh heavily. This story show us a realistic experience on being homosexual in Japan.\r\n\r\nAuthor Go Fujimoto received an honorable mention at the 51st Shogakukan Newcomer Comic Grand Prize in 2002 for this piece.",
