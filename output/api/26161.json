  "description": "Ten years ago, Ben was the first person to be infected by a strange disease that causes flowers to grow from his body every spring and summer. In a world where flowers have become frightening, Ben has come to accept that most people will want to keep their distance from his dandelions. However, when an enthusiastic photographer arrives out of the blue and asks Ben to be a part of his project, Ben begins to discover what being a &ldquo;flowerpot&rdquo; really means.",
