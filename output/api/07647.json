  "description": "Miss Marilla Cuthbert and Mr. Matthew Cuthbert, middle-aged siblings who live together at Green Gables, a farm in Avonlea, on Prince Edward Island, decide to adopt an orphan boy from the asylum as a helper on their farm. Through a series of mishaps, what ends up under their roof is a precocious girl of eleven named Anne Shirley. Anne is bright and quick, eager to please but dissatisfied with her name, her pale countenance dotted with freckles, and with her long braids of red hair. Being a child of imagination, however, Anne takes much joy in life, and adapts quickly, thriving in the environment of Prince Edward Island.\r\n\r\nSee [url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=421]AnimeNewsNetwork[/url] for the anime.\r\nSee [url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=20682]AnimeNewsNetwork[/url] for the anime movie.\r\nSee [url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=10550]AnimeNewsNetwork[/url] for the prequel.",
