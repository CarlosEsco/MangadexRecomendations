  "description": "Aoi Destruction is a compilation of short stories by Kazurou Inoue (Midori no Hibi and Aikora).\r\n\r\n1) The first 3 chapters are dedicated to the title story (Aoi Destruction). Tough Guy Tetsuo lives a complicated life alone with his father, Aoi. Nothing strange about that, except, Aoi looks and acts like a little girl.\r\n\r\n2) is 'Rare Bookshop Owner Yakou's Hard-Fighting Chronicles'. Yakou was left to run his father's rare book store and bitterly resents it. Then a super-hot babe walks into his store. She's a &quot;book-detective&quot; and tells him she's taking over the store so Yakou can pursue his family's heritage--the &quot;other job...&quot;.\r\n\r\n3) is 'Full Scratch Eiji,' about a boy who tries to get away from his otaku past. He was a legend among figure makers, &quot;E-Model-san,&quot; until a girl rejected him for being too &quot;otaku.&quot; Yoshizaka is easily the big man on campus; adoring girls throng about him. Jealous boys chew their livers. Then he stops to help a goofy girl--who is thrilled to meet &quot;E-Model-san&quot;! She could ruin everything; he has to shut her up!\r\n\r\n4) is 'Otone no Naisho,' a story about a young samurai girl who finds herself the owner of a perverted possessed katana.",
