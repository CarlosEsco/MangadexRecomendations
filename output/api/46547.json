  "description": "Taku Kinashi&rsquo;s just moved to Tokyo this spring to attend college, with the dream of getting himself a pretty girlfriend and having his first time at last. He just can&rsquo;t wait to finally live alone like he&rsquo;s always wanted. After settling in, he goes to greet his new neighbor, and who should come out of the door but&hellip; a smoldering-hot young man with his shirt hanging open displaying his soft, glistening chest and supple thighs! What&rsquo;s more, he seems to know Taku from somewhere&hellip;! What happens when a plain old college straight boy like Taku lives-under the same roof as an irresistible, exhibitonistic flirt like Mitsuru?",
