She pretended that it was alright while he was there, but as soon as he left she began to cry. The kind and cool Jun was passing by and gave her some sweet chocolate to cheer her up. The next day, they discover that they go to the same school. What will happen with this pair whose introduction was so sweet?\r\n\r\n5) Juonteki na Kanojo aka My Grudging Girlfriend:\r\nAfter losing a bet to his friends, Ginji, a well known playboy of his school, has to ask out Kei Natsumi, &ldquo;the darkest woman in school&rdquo;, as the kids call her.
