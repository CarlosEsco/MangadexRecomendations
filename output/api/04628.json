  "description": "A tale of obsessive love and constant pursuit, told over a 1000 years.\r\n\r\nEscaping from a brother who had just ascended the throne, Yoshitsune, along with his servant, comes across a house in the middle of a desolate mountain. Oddly enough, only a young woman lives there, who seems to possess a very dark and ominous past.\r\nThis long journey of more than a thousand years focuses on our main protagonist Kurou. It can be somewhat confusing at the beginning, but once you understand the plot this story can be quite entertaining.\r\nThe main thrust of the story goes like this: Kurou meets a beautiful woman by the name of Kuromitsu, and begins a relationship which transcends life and memory. Kurozuka tells the tale of a journey undertaken by immortals, and those who chase after immortality.\r\nThe majority of this story takes place many centuries in the future, after Kurou has been separated from Kuromitsu. Having lost almost all of his memories, Kurou seeks to understand why he cannot die, to rediscover his identity, and to find the woman that haunts his dreams.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Polish / Polski:[/u][/b]  [spoiler]Fascynuj\u0105ca opowie\u015b\u0107 o mi\u0142o\u015bci, prawdziwej, zrodzonej z duszy i z potrzeby.
