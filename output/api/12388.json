Can Fukami recover the key or has he met his match in Muromachi?\r\n\r\n3) Shoujo Comic Supporter\r\nHarumi and Yuusuke were next door neighbors growing up. Yuusuke being much older than Harumi eventually left to attend college. Before leaving, Yuusuke gave Harumi a shoujo manga as a parting gift. Although Harumi didn&rsquo;t initially have an interest in shoujo manga, after reading the series Yuusuke recommended, he became a fan of shoujo manga.\r\n\r\nBy time Harumi reaches high school he is obsessed with shoujo manga. He attempts to establish a shoujo manga club but is rejected by the student council president, Yoshiaki. Harumi and his club are supported by none other than Yuusuke who is now a teacher at Harumi&rsquo;s school.\r\n\r\nSuffering from the constant frustration of having the group&rsquo;s hard efforts to establish the shoujo manga club rejected, is there anything Harumi can do to persuade the student council president? And if there is, will Yuusuke continue to support him or stand in his way?\r\n\r\n4) Things That Were Forgotten in the Basement",
