  "description": "Brilliant jazz saxophonist Yashiro Shunichi has never recovered from the loss of his beloved pianist in an accident sixteen years ago. While his career has brought him success and fame, self imposed isolation and total immersion in music are taking a personal toll. Then a chance encounter with a young drummer and pianist leads him to consider establishing a new band. But allowing others into his life makes him more vulnerable than he could have imagined.",
