  "description": "Mo Qi was born unable to cultivate, so he had decided to work as a chef in a cuisine restaurant. He had stumbled upon a 'cookbook', which he had mistakingly used to cook food however, this was no ordinary cookbook - it was the peerless scripture of chaos. Things start to take a turn when Mo Qin realises his body is getting sturdier, and he is starting to get stronger!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was written by me, as the original description wasn't the greatest. \r\n- Asura",
