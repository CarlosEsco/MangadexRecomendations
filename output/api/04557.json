  "description": "1: Cherry Paranoia\r\nKitagawa gets confessed to by the popular, Yamamoto. Taking advantage of the situation, he accepts and they start going out. But, Kitagawa has a secret that he would die before letting Yamamoto know about... Can their relationship work out, or will the secret be exposed?! \r\n\r\n2-3: A Way Too Perverted Friend\r\nKeisuke have been friends with Atsushi, the ace of the baseball team, since middle school. One night, like any other usual one, Keisuke crashes at Atsushi's place after gaming away, only to wake up to Atsushi calling out his name while masturbating.\r\n\r\n4: A Way Too Exciting Friend\r\nAfter catching himself staring at Suou's sleeping face, Ayumu noticed his more-than-friends-feelings for Suou. Knowing that this love would be fruitless, Ayumu resigns to his fate and begins to avoid his friend... which doesn't exactly sit well with the person in question. \r\n\r\n5: Malicious Love Lesson\r\nNo one else offered to help him besides the president of Student Council, Nishida. That's why Kazuya couldn't help but fall in love with the gentle and princely Nishida. However, his meek nature makes talking, let alone confessing, to the object of his affections all the more difficult. So he seeks Nishida's scary second-in-command Tamaki for assistance.",
