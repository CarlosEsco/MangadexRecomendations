Tsukishima possesses a perfect body type, which Yamaji loves to sketch. Reflecting on that perfection, Yamaji realizes his own body is less than perfect - flabby! - and he needs to improve it before Tsukishima rejects him because of it.\r\n\r\n2. Zaiaku wa Hada no Ue ni (Sin Is Above Skin Level)\r\nTsukishima, a regular businessman, has begun a blissful life living with his lover Yamaji. But though things are happy on the surface, Tsukishima can't shake the feeling that Yamaji only likes his body...\r\n\r\n3. Hada no Ue ni Furu Hana (The Flowers Touch)\r\nTsukishima and Yamaji admire the cherry blossoms together. While looking at the beautiful trees, Tsukishima thinks that Yamaji is far more beautiful. A springtime continuation with our lovely couple.\r\n\r\n4. Renai Tsuu (Heartache)\r\nWhen stoic Mizusawa, a janitor, saves businessman Aoki from falling down some stairs, he gets a friend for life! Aoki is always tracking him down at lunch time just so they can eat together. But Mizusawa isn't sure how he feels about Aoki...\r\n\r\n5. Renai Tsuu - Akka\r\n\r\n6. Yurusareta Uta (Permitted Song)\r\nHumans keep monsters as slaves for fighting and protection, but there is one, Zai who refuses to fight. Zai is special since he can use magic by creating spells with his songs, but he refuses to sing too... will he, for his master?",
