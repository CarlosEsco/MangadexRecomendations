  "description": "This is the story of a teenage boy named Takeru Tachibana and his struggle to recover his sister Sayoko from a &quot;cyborg dogfight circuit&quot;. When Takeru was 10 years old, his town was bombed during an enemy air-raid in which his parents were killed and he was mortally wounded. Sayoko, cut deep with &quot;survivor's guilt&quot; and a &quot;co-dependent&quot; inability to deal with living alone, rashly sells her brain to the Albion Corporation run by a mysterious CEO named V&eacute;ltare Mar&ccedil;eau in order to pay for a risky surgical operation that Takeru may or may not survive. Her brain is placed in a cybernetic body, the process of which essentially eliminates the brain's memories and heightens its aggression. Her new identity is The White 13, or &quot;The Ice Doll&quot;, and for the next five years she is placed on a dogfight circuit fighting other cyborgs in gladiator-style extravaganzas where she eventually becomes the grand champion and obtains the rank of &quot;sirius&quot;...\r\n\r\nThe story begins shortly after Takeru has liberated his sister from the dogfight circuit only to discover that, outside the cicuit, Sayoko's brain has a &quot;self-destruct&quot; mechanism and that she is dying. Takeru has one week to find a way to cure his sister or return her to the circuit or she will die. Adding to the problem are the &quot;dogged&quot; efforts of the Albion Corporation to recover &quot;their stolen property&quot; as well as a cast of characters who all have their own scars of some sort...",
