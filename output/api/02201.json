  "description": "&quot;With my beloved boyfriend I want to do that and this...&quot; Every girl who's fallen in love before will nod because they're full of &quot;No-Good Fantasies&quot;! This should fill your maidens' hearts for sure!\r\n\r\n\r\n1) Do you Really Love me? - Minase Ai\r\nI love him but he's from a different world... that's how I thought but then I caught Itou-kun kissing my desk, is it that he likes me....\r\n\r\n2) Invention Princess - Kumagai Kyoko\r\nShizuka - super genius inventor has continued to look at her first crush since she first approached him at age ten. Originally to capture him she created useless inventions in a crazed rampage of wild delusions.\r\n\r\n3) Why the Boy Reads Shoujo Manga - Hattori Miki\r\nThe one Rinko likes is the kind, cool, honest shoujo manga hero Jun-kun (two dimensional). She's fast approaching a dream as she has feelings for Sekimoto Mako!?\r\n\r\n4) Public Moral Committee Chairman's M Note - Souda Momo\r\nI, the public moral committee chairman sneakily wrote erotic delusions on a secret note! That note was discovered, and on top of that he orders me to &quot;Listen to what I say!&quot; I can't stop my increasing delusions!\r\n\r\n5) Misunderstanding Girl &amp; Angry Prince - Shiumi Saki\r\nIt seems like Kouga-kun who often meets my eyes likes me and Keiko, brimming with confidence confessed to him. As a result she was misunderstood and turned down. Furthermore she transformed into Kouga's favourite...?\r\n\r\n6) Onii-chan, please kiss me - Ginnobashi Rin\r\nIyo became siblings with childhood friend Shouichi-kun after their parents remariage. She'll definitely become a family with Shouichi! One way or another it was a mistake to train her little brother.\r\n\r\n7) Kouryakuseyo! - Hanamoto Asami\r\nShe loves Shoujo games!!! And the she met a boy who is just like the Prince she longs for in the game!!! She'll definitely capture him!",
