  "description": "When a mysterious explosion killed an entire class full of high school students, the souls of everyone in class were transported into a fantasy world and reincarnated. While some students were reincarnated as princes or prodigies, others were not as blessed.\r\nOur heroine, who was the lowest in the class, discovered that she was reincarnated as a spider! Now at the bottom of the food chain, she needs to adapt to the current situation with willpower in order to live. Stuck in a dangerous labyrinth filled with monsters, it's eat or be eaten!\r\nThis is the story of a spider doing whatever she can in order to survive!\r\n\r\n[hr][b][u]Russian / \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439:[/u][/b]\r\n[spoiler]\u0412 \u0440\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u044a\u044f\u0441\u043d\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f \u0441 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0435\u043c \u043f\u0438\u043a\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441 \u043e\u0431\u044b\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u044f\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0431\u0430\u0435\u0442, \u043d\u043e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0435. \u0410 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0435\u0439 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438\u043d\u0435, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043e\u043f\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0432 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0435, \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0437\u043b\u043e \u043a\u0443\u0434\u0430 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u043f\u0430\u0443\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0437\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0435, \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0421\u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u043b\u0438 \u043e\u043d\u0430, \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443\u044f \u043b\u0438\u0448\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u0445\u0438\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u0443\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0443, \u0432\u044b\u0436\u0438\u0442\u044c?[/spoiler]",
