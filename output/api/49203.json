  "description": "Nguyet, an actress specializing in villainess roles in cheesy romance films, has transmigrated into the plot of the movie she just acted in. According to the script, she'll be burned alive at the age of 20. Not wanting to meet such a hellish ending, Nguyet is determined to win over the male lead so that he won't have any reason to hate her. In doing so however, the male lead ends up falling in love with her, the villainess! Nguyet now tries to get the plot's original romance back on track, but it seems like it's impossible?!\r\n\r\n[i]Note: This is a Viet Comic, so please read from Left to Right![/i]\r\n\r\n(*) This is not incest.\r\n\r\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKvoOwlacRoJTEGE8k0br_q_UAnO9CPfo]Motion comic[/url]",
