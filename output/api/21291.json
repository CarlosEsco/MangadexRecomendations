On the otherhand, the bronze saints are on their way to save Athena.\r\n\r\n--\r\nEris is the goddess of chaos and uses the body of Elien, who is a friend of Hyoga, to revive herself. She obtains the golden apple to drain Athena's life energy to make her ressurection complete and to be able to turn the world in a place filled with chaos. But to be able to attack Eris, Seiya and his friends will first have to defeat the Ghost Knights.\r\n--\r\nIn northern Europe, the reincarnation of Odin, Dolbar, rules supreme. One day, Hyoga rescues a man in Siberia so warns him about trouble in the Asgard. Athena goes out to investigate and sends Hyoga in advance but when she and the others arrive at the Asgard, Hyoga is nowhere to be found. When Dolbar captures Athena to take control of the sanctuary, the bronze saints try to help her but are attacked by the God Warriors.\r\n--\r\nLucifer has been awoken from his eternal slumber by the spirits of Eris, Abel and Poseidon. He has come to kill Athena and fulfill his heart's burning desire: becoming the strongest of all the gods.",
