  "description": "Yokoi Taku has trouble getting along with people, so he moved to Tokyo as soon as he graduated from high school. He now lives alone, making a living by delivering newspapers and drawing doujinshi, though people totally ignore his non-erotic works. One day, a girl named Saitou Megumi suddenly shows up at his door, claiming that she came all the way from Tottori to meet him because she's a big fan of one of his original works. It ends up that she has faced many hardships herself, and with no intention of leaving, she ends up living with him.\r\n[hr]\r\nThe author of the manga is requesting people send a message to the editor on Twitter to gauge interest in an official English release.
