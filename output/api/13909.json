  "description": "Award-winning work.\r\n\r\nThis pair of daughter-in-law and mother-in-law is far from ordinary! \r\nWar is not the tragedy of the human race.\r\nThe tragedy of all mankind is the impossibility of choosing one's parents and children.\r\nLife partners can be chosen. Not in-laws.\r\n\r\nBut rest assured, the greatest tragedy of the human race is actually entertaining! Main Street in Elysium makes an amusing satire of our pains.\r\n\r\nThe on-going mortal combat between Noriko and her mother-in-law who take up residence on Main Street. The wacky neighbors who bring their own craziness to the set. This hairy combination creates the dark world of Elysium. Beware: it's addictive.",
