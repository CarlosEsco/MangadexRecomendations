  "description": "Winning isn't everything in the game of basketball, but who wants to come in second? It takes dedication and discipline to be the best, and the Shohoku High hoops team wants to be just that. They have one last year to make their captain's dream of reaching the finals come true--will they do it? Takehiko Inoue's legendary beloved basketball manga is finally here and the tale of a lifetime is in your hands.\r\n\r\nHanamichi Sakuragi's got no game with girls&mdash;none at all! It doesn't help that he's known for throwing down at a moment's notice and always coming out on top. A hopeless bruiser, he's been rejected by 50 girls in a row! All that changes when he meets the girl of his dreams, Haruko, and she's actually not afraid of him! When she introduces him to the game of basketball, his life is changed forever...\r\n\r\nNote: Includes a oneshot called 10 Days After.\r\n\r\nIn 1995 Slam Dunk received the 40th Shogakukan Manga Award for shounen.",
