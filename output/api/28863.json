  "description": "&quot;I won't hand you over to anyone, Yume.&quot; One day, Taiyo, a handsome delinquent, fell from the sky right in front of hard-core yaoi fan Yume. He's got a mean stare, blond hair, and he's terrifying... &quot;RUN!&quot; Or so Yume thought, but he actually has a super sexy voice! What's more, he spends every day fooling around with his male classmate! Yume thinks about hearing him moan... Then starts fantasizing about it... Then her foot slips, and... suddenly she's on top of his face... &quot;Ah! Wait... No... If you move your lips down there, I'm going to... Nh! I can't take it...!&quot; An overly earnest and pure punk boy and a perverted girl's comedic love story begins!",
