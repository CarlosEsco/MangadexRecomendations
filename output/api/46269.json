  "description": "Story 1: Suou Hatasu is a nice guy with a pretty normal life. Like most college students, he's living alone in a little shoebox apartment and commutes on-foot. In spite of his financial limitations, he's fairly satified with his life: he's got a good friend, a cute girlfriend and is just starting his first student-teaching job at an area high school.\r\n\r\nThings only seem to be getting better for him when one of his students, handsome and fabulously wealthy Harashima Daichi, seems to take a shine to him. Immediately feeling welcomed to his new school, Suou couldn't really ask for more. Until his new &quot;buddy&quot; Harashima suddenly turns on him in a deserted hallway and vows to make Suou &quot;his property&quot;.\r\n\r\nCan money really buy love? Harashima certainly seems to think so...\r\n\r\nStory 2: Three childhood friends, Yoshito, Sei and Daisuke, come to a crossroads in their relationship when Yoshito announces he's getting married. Sei's composure crumbles and he admits to having loved Yoshito since Middle School. But while Sei's been chasing after Yoshito, he's been too preoccupied to notice that Daisuke's been chasing after him.",
