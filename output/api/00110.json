  "description": "[b][u]English[/u][/b]\r\nPopular high school student Suwa Daisuke has no interest in dating newcomer Aikawa Hinako, a quiet loner. That's because she recoiled from his flirtatious touch, and he took it as a personal affront. Daisuke informs one of his buddies that he wouldn't date her, not knowing Hinako was listening. Daisuke's attitude changes after he accidentally hears her confession in an abandoned church; she's been sexually abused by her stepfather and has given up a child for adoption. His former annoyance turns to compassion and concern. Hinako is unaware that he knows her terrible secret. Believing him to have no romantic interest, she becomes more relaxed and comfortable in his company. Their relationship faces a lot of obstacles, including jealous classmates.\r\n[b][u]Polski[/u][/b]\r\n[spoiler]Gdzie\u015b w odleg\u0142ej Japonii grupa nastolatk&oacute;w prze\u017cywa dramaty swojego \u017cycia.
