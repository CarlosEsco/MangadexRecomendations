  "description": "Nevada, 1987.\r\n\r\n10 years after the end of the nuclear war, the country has been rebuilt. Nevertheless, thousands of civils are still irradiated. Fortunately the government developed a treatment : the G.H.O.S.T. (Gray-Human-Omegon-Synthetised-Treatment). By using it, a human being can slow down the effects of radiation on his body, but at the same time he begins to control them. That&rsquo;s how men who are able to use G.H.O.S.T. to acquire incredible abilities are appearing. They are called Erynies.\r\n\r\nAt 23-years-old, Kama is a low-ranking bounty hunter who owns a slum in a shantytown where the irradiated people too poor to afford the G.H.O.S.T. are living. His main activity is to hunt Erynies. One day, he is asked to capture a young woman: Ananke, the leader of an extremist group which stole an H bomb in a military base. Its utilisation on the territory could mean the end of the fragile peace for the planet. But for 50 million dollars, Kama won&rsquo;t be the only one looking for Ananke; he is going to go up against the greatest of bounty hunters.",
