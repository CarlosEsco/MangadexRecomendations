  "description": "After trying and failing to confess to his crush Amekawa-kun in middle school, shy and introverted Iishima thinks that if only he were cute like a girl, he too would be able to express his love to the guy he likes. Flashforward several years and Iishima's working part-time as a crossdresser, something that's both enjoyable and empowering for him. But then he finds out that Rina-san, his crossdressing colleague, is none other than Amekawa-kun!",
