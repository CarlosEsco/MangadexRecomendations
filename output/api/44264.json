  "description": "After signing a contract to get her romance webtoon serialized, college student Son Woori comes home to get dumped by her girlfriend. A homophobic (or not?) neighbor witnesses the whole ordeal. With the added pressure of deadlines for her webtoon, she has little time to deal with her heartbreak. It doesn't make it easier that this neighbor, who claims she doesn't want to get involved, keeps running into her!\r\nfrom Tapas:\r\nHell yeah! A major publisher wants Mai Sohn to write a webcomic on relationships. But she&rsquo;s struck with heartbreak as her girlfriend abruptly dumps her. It&rsquo;s hard writing about relationships without being in one, so she needs to find the inspiration for love &mdash; and find it fast. And what&rsquo;s up with her possibly homophobic neighbor? Why is she cool with Mai one minute and then so awkward and weird to her the next?! Can&rsquo;t a girl catch a break?",
