  "description": "Suddenly transported to another world. \r\n\r\nI was called the &quot;suitable one,&quot; he who could handle the world's strongest power, that of the &quot;holy sword.&quot;\r\n\r\nI thought I would be using that power to make a great impact in this new world.\r\n\r\nHowever, the world was such that humans were abusing &quot;monsters&quot; and &quot;beasts.&quot;\r\n\r\nQuestioning my own convictions, I ask, is this correct? Who should I use this power for?\r\n\r\nThis is the beginning of an Isekai battle fantasy!\r\n\r\ntl;dr:  Isekai.  Humans are genocidal bastards and enslaving demi-humans.  Don't even think to sugarcoat this to the chosen one.  Chosen one sides with demi-humans. :surprised pikachu face:",
