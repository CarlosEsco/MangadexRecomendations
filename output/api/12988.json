  "description": "Ozu Kotarou (25) recently changed his career from a white collar worker to a high school teacher. His new workplace is at Odawara High School, a girls only school. He starts off his first day by leaving a significant impression on the entire school by announcing that he has no interest in younger girls, especially under age girls. Kotarou is assigned to assist Hara Takako, a fellow teacher, until he gets experience teaching. Hara is a beautiful 32 year old woman but is insecure about being single and is worried about her future. How will the relationship between these two people develop as they start working closely together?",
