  "description": "Chousoku Sonic's stories are generally self-contained and light-hearted, with little to no connections to the game continuity (although there are occasional references to previously released games, such as Sonic Adventure 2). Despite this, they feature several characters from the games, including Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower, Knuckles the Echidna, Amy Rose, Dr. Eggman, Shadow the Hedgehog and Chao. \r\n\r\nThey feature a lot of slapstick humor and foul language.",
