  "description": "A collection of images from Twitter\r\n&quot;The artist has never given the story a proper name so &quot;Story of a certain Ikazuchi&quot; is taken from the one of the replies to his Tweets. The name was taken because the artist rejected notions of &quot;World Line&quot; in his works, so Shipgirls from his works are essentially dups living in different parts of the same cruel world.&quot; - \u5cac\u3061\u3083\u3093",
