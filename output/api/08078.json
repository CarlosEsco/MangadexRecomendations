  "description": "Touched by the Black Death, a little girl becomes a zombie. Twenty years later... Leaving the boring, repetitive work at the smithy behind, Van manages to escape the premises, only to be caught by George, standing guard at the gates. Though he receives an earful and a chase, Van still manages to escape. George had been fearing Van growing up for a while and can't help but get a bad feeling as he sees him disappear. He yells at Van to not go near the Restricted area. Though he replied &quot;alright,&quot; Van headed towards the North Gates, a request of Edmond's. Feeling the adrenaline, as he watches the two lookouts, a man suddenly appears and kills the two, leaving the Gate open. Soon, smelling the blood, four zombies hobble in and start attacking the injured guards. Van decides that he needs to let somebody know, but was exposed to the zombies in the process. As his strength leaves his legs, the zombies catch up to him. Just when the zombies are near and Van is sure he's dying, a sudden surge of strength emerges from his body and Van starts to overpower the zombies...",
