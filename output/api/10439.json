  "description": "Tsubasa lives in a hotspring town that is about to fade away from a bad economy. He is a middle school delinquent, and is beat up at school almost every day. He has a secret, though: he is a psychic, but he is embarrassed of this fact because his abilities are &quot;lame&quot; and not worth bragging about. One day, however, he realizes that he can read the mind of a mute girl named Yuki.",
