  "description": "Hatanaka Keiko's an odd girl with odd aspirations (I mean, REALLY weird), but she tries her best to fit in with the other girls in her class... She still sucks at it, though.\r\n\r\nOne day, she meets Asami, a girl who's even more of an outcast than she is--but unlike Keiko, Asami's own &quot;outsider&quot; status doesn't seem to bother her in the slightest.\r\n\r\nAs they grow closer, what's going to happen to Keiko's standing among the other girls? And what about Asami's own issues?",
