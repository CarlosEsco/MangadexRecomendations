  "description": "Bronte is running away from a failed wedding ceremony in the rain when she finds a cabin for shelter, occupied by a blood-soaked man with Gold eyes, who claims he just killed a man. His name is Mars West, and on impulse he kisses her, just as the police come to drag him away.\r\n\r\nFive years later Bronte comes to New York to see Mars, who spent three years in prison for the murder it turns out he didn&rsquo;t commit. Then things get strange&hellip;\r\n\r\nThis is a soap opera of the highest order, with machinations and manipulations that only the very rich could get away with&hellip;\r\n\r\nBased on Ann Major's novel, &quot;Secret Child&quot;.",
