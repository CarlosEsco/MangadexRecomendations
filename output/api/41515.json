  "description": "6 years ago, Chika found herself in an unknown world and was promptly forced into a human trafficking ring. She was later bought by the stern-faced Douglas, a famous and powerful knight. At that point, Chika thought she would be sentenced to a life of serving her master's every whims, no matter how perverted... but Douglas can't get it up?!\r\n\r\nIt seems that in the past, he was captured as a prisoner of war, and an experience with a &quot;male slave&quot; (really Chika with short hair) traumatized him to the point of impotence. While Chika is happy to do his chores and be doted on by him, his sexual trauma is a sore point for her. Will she ever be able to completely satisfy him, both as a maid and as a woman?\r\n[hr][u][b]Chinese[/b][/u]\r\n\u52e4\u52b3\u7684\u5974\u96b6\u4e0e\u5979\u7684\u4e0d\u4e3e\u4e3b\u4eba",
