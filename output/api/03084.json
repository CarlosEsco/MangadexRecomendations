  "description": "Rio is a 14 year old boy with no particular special traits, except his burning love for books. He&rsquo;s awkward and considered odd at best by his peers. Rio also has a twin brother, Mao. Although they look alike, they couldn&rsquo;t be more different. Mao is good at everything, popular, and has future plans to have a big, happy family. Despite their differences, the brothers are close.\r\n\r\nOne day, when Rio attempts to retrieve a cat that wandered into the street, he is hit by a car right in front of his brother&rsquo;s eyes. Everything fades to black. In the darkness, a voice offers a choice: to live or to die. Fading rapidly, Rio gives the obvious answer: to live! Turns out this was quite the loaded proposition.\r\n\r\nRio awakens in a world filled with foreigners and strange animals he&rsquo;s never seen before. That&rsquo;s not the only odd thing&ndash;Rio now has the form of a black cat! He quickly learns cats are revered in this world because of their special role as familiars of wizards.",
