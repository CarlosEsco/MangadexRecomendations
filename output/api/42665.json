No matter how you look at it he's a risky guy, but his sinister prophecies are always right. A puppy that high schooler Yori got from her boyfriend dies. Later, a middle-aged man drowns after falling into a waterfall, a giant fire occurs in the city, and... even more?! The scary, the grotesque, even the ridiculous: a collection of bizarre horror stories!",
