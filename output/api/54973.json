  "description": "&quot;I've finally found you... my alpha...!&quot;\r\nThe plain alpha, Yoshihiko, works at a marriage counseling office. One day, a stern-looking delinquent omega, Momo, comes knocking on their doors to propose to him! After being turned down, Momo suddenly yells, &quot;I'll do anything! Please, just go out with me!&quot; and suddenly lunges at him!! Yoshihiko was turned on watching the delinquent desperately try to pleasure him. He wasn't any good, but when he looked up at him with watery eyes, Yoshihiko couldn't hold himself back...! Ever since, Momo continued to passionately approach him... When their bodies got close, his revealing clothes and intoxicating scent had left Yoshihiko dizzy with desire.\r\nThe unguarded, alluring and pure delinquent omega is just too cute! How can Yoshihiko bear it...?!",
