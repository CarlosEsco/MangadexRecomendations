  "description": "Ichabod is a young boy trying to find his biological father. This pursuit isn't made any easier by his tendency to get into trouble with the law. To top things off, his parents are just downright weird: Ichabod was raised by a lesbian couple. Thank god he meets Kirico, who is anything but ordinary.\r\n\r\nA very peculiar and interesting manga from the nineties, with some serious topics from psychology and society and unique characters.\r\nTell me if you would like me to the translate more chapters (although, unfortunately, these are far less interesting than the first chapter, which just has something to it). A manga which traumatised me and my little brother when we first read it back in the early 2000s, but also made me think alot, even to this very day. RIP Hiroyuki Shoji. \r\n\r\nFor this scanlation I used the German translation that was made by Burkhard H&ouml;fler and released in Manga Power, a monthly manga compendium that came out in Germany in the early 2000s. Sadly, I don't have enough experience to know if I have chosen the right format.",
