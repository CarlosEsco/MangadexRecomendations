  "description": "This is a short comic by Shintaro Kago that portrays a dystopian future where human beings are mostly manufactured instead of born, except for in ghettos where they are mostly abandoned at birth. The story starts with a woman complaining to her doctor/therapist that her husband won't have sex with her and then it goes off on a tangent explaining what happened to her husband and how it came to pass. Involves a car accident that sets loose a dangerous breed of genetically engineered hyper-intelligent killer babies.",
