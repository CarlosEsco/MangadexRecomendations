As a virgin, he uses his wild and vivid imagination and envisions himself in a sexual relationship with Ichihara Ibuki, one of the heroines from one of his favorite TV shows from when he was a child. Bon finds out that one of his new schoolmates is the beautiful Momose Koharu, who he used to be childhood friends with, and his life soon becomes chaotic. But just when Bon thought life could not get crazier, his world is turned upside down when he learns that the new school nurse is none other than Mitsuba Touko, the actress who played Ichihara Ibuki, his imaginary lover.",
