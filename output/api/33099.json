  "description": "As he was being defeated, the Demon King used the last of his strength to curse Sir Roel, the legendary captain of the Holy Knights, into the body of a weak girl. Roel &mdash; who was a woman to begin with! &mdash; tired of her former life and unable to return to her original body, decides to live a luxurious life as Sila Epheria, the noble daughter whose soul got swapped with hers. Things don't go according to plan when her new family puts her in danger, forcing her to find a way to prove her true identity... \r\n\r\nWill Roel/Sila be able to live a quiet life as she wishes? Or is there something more to the new life she's received?",
