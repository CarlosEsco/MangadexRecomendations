  "description": "Leticia's father, the current king, is very wise and knew that both of his older sons have their own supporters, and that if either one became king, the other brother's supporters would rebel&mdash;throwing the country into a civil war.\r\n\r\nTo prevent this, the king decided to announce that he will retire while he's still alive and make his daughter, the princess, his successor! However, the princess doesn't have any political allies. So she decides to gather a group of knights loyal to her and form her own &quot;round table&quot; before the day of her coronation.\r\n\r\nThe only problem is all of the good knights who are strong and skillful and loyal have already been snatched up by her father and brothers for their own personal guards...\r\n\r\nBased on a light novel: [url=https://bookwalker.jp/series/1058/list/]Bookwalker[/url].",
