  "description": "Long ago in the very distant past, it is said that civilization had developed to high degrees, and its people spent peaceful and plentiful days without an inconvenience. The people thought their peaceful and tranquil lives would continue forever. But on that day, when the \u300cstars\u300d fell from the skies, legends say that all civilizations on earth announced the end and perished in an instant.\r\n\r\nHowever, the stars that fell on \u300cthat day\u300d did not merely bring about destruction to earth. In the flowing long months and days, the mysterious powers possessed by the stars gave a new potential to people. That possibility was a \u300cnew mankind\u300d who were gifted with power from the stars. From the day the new population became aware of the mysterious power attained from the stars, research started on the usage of the \u300cpower\u300d. This signaled the raising of the curtain of the era of a new civilization led by the \u300cpower of the stars\u300d, Meteo Civilization.\r\n\r\nThe power of the stars that surpasses mankind and transcends everything... people call this new star \u300cNova\u300d.",
