  "description": "When K-books turned 15 years old in 2008, a collection consisting of artbooks, special phone cards and many other products was released, to thank its customers. <br /><br />Please read the below notes carefully for the contents of EACH volume.<br /><br />Note #1: This collection comprises of 2 separate artbooks as in, 1 for the boys and 1 for the girls. The particular names are Boys side and Girls Side and neither of the 2 are likely complete. <br /><br />Note #2: Boys&#39; side = often ecchi and with some images featuring some nudity. One of the images was lolicon, soo I left it out in accordance with Batoto&#39;s site policy. I mean: you don&#39;t want me to start censoring by drawing on someone&#39;s art, right? The image in question was by Kiyotaka Haimura, if anyone&#39;s extremely curious.  <br /><br />Girls&#39; side = mostly shounen-ai but some of the images are not. Nothing that really qualifies as &quot;mature&quot; for this artbook.",
