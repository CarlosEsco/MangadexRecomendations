  "description": "Daiki, a university student, has fallen in love at first sight with his beautiful, black-haired classmate, Mitsui. One day, during a group date, he sees someone near the store who looks just like Mitsui and follows him, to find that it is actually his classmate in women's clothing! When Daiki asks him the reason for his cross-dressing, Mitsui tells him that it's due to his part-time job as a &quot;rental boyfriend.&quot;",
