  "description": "1) The Fallen Angel\r\nTamaki Ouga always breaks curfew, and always get caught by dorm leader and student council president Mitsumoto Hizuru. Tired of being punished, Tamaki is determined to charm Mitsumoto, but finds himself drawn in by the strict and enigmatic president.\r\n\r\n2) SUPER! Love Bang\r\nHozumi Taizou is running out of time! His beloved Arikawa sempai is graduating this year, and with Hozumi's poor grades there's no chance of going to the same school as a genius like Arikawa. But Arikawa persistantly ignores Hozumi.\r\n\r\n3) Because I'm All for the Justice\r\nWhen ridiculously strong transfer student Amashiro Tatsumi helps out small justice-seeking Mikumo Yoshito, Mikumo begs him to join The Security Club. Amashiro agrees on one condition: that beautiful member Yuuna agrees to go out with him. But is Amashiro only being valued for his strength?\r\n\r\n4) Pure Love, Honest Boy\r\nHigh-schooler Miyoshi Takechi may be the only person in the world who doesn't know about &quot;those&quot; kind of massage parlors! An advertisement in a magazine picturing the beautiful Kazuma compels the nerdy student to visit. Though he left abruptly, Takechi is pursued by Kazuma.\r\n\r\n5) Use of Magic\r\nSegou Tasuka has always been a bit useless. Never smart enough or strong enough to surpass his older brother. Tasuka lives alone, and when he father hires Toudou Yuugiri to serves as his caretaker, Tasuka's not interested. But Yuugiri's not giving up! He knows Tasuka can be the best and he's going to help.\r\n\r\n6) Angel's Rest?\r\nA look at Tamaki from Mitsumoto's point of view.",
