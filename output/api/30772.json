  "description": "Traveling in-between the world of the living and the twilight world of the dead, Akamushi, the shaman, priest, demon-hunter, or specifically, the Red Spider Exorcist, is one that&rsquo;ll never refuse a request for help from lost souls falling prey to evil spirits and demons of the underworld. With the strength and regeneration powers of a giant spider, and the ability to command his swarm of arachnids to his will, he combats the malevolent supernatural and is a force to be reckoned with.\r\n\r\nWhen career woman Megumi is suddenly pursued and attacked by the unholy demons of the afterlife, she seeks the help from the phlegmatic shaman to eradicate the infestation of unholy beasts seeking to take her soul and turn her into a vindictive minion. But as it seems, these demons are more than persistent&mdash;everywhere Megumi tries to hide, they follow. With Megumi&rsquo;s cry for help, is this more than what Akamushi can handle&mdash;as he too collapses to the will of their malicious powers?\r\n\r\nBut why are these creatures of twilight after her? What does she know, or doesn&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;ll unravel the truths about her true self and everyone around her? And what of Akamushi&mdash;can he use his unique shamanic spider-like powers to cast out and purify himself from the demon scourge?",
