  "description": "1-3: A Place for Half a Rent\r\nShiraishi, a hardworking college student who smiles even when he's upset, is openly gay. His family and coworkers have a hard time accepting him, with the exception of his part-time job manager, Kanzaki, who doesn't smile even when he's happy. When Shiraishi can no longer force himself to keep living with his friendly but unfaithful boyfriend, Kanzaki makes him an offer: &quot;Want to come to my place?&quot;\r\n\r\n4-5: I'm Serious in My Own Way\r\nYukito Shibata is in a pickle. He has one... no, two problems! His ex-boyfriend, Yoshioka Seiji, wants them to get back together, but it was Yoshioka who betrayed him in the first place. So he's having second thoughts. Meanwhile his step-nephew, Utsui Keigo, confesses his love for him! Keigo is seven years younger, but he's very persistent. Which one should he accept?\r\n\r\n6: Don't Be So Strict\r\nIs it so easy to have an affair? Megumu wonders in pain, when he finds that Keiichi has cheated on him for the fifth time in three years. Being poor, with no money and only a part time job, it's already hard enough for him to keep living while taking care of Keiichi's needs. But he runs away from it all... just to learn &ndash; the hard way &ndash; how an affair can blossom, and what consequences it might bring! Will the experience keep their relationship alive, or will it separate them in the end?",
