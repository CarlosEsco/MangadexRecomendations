  "description": "In the not so distant future in Japan, there is a secret game for boys who have experienced their sexual awakening. Making a contract with an onee-san, the competition takes the style of a card game where the master can give an order to dress the slave in erotic clothing or perform a skill. Only when it is approved by the slave, the order goes through. In other words, a game that tests the love between the master and slave.",
