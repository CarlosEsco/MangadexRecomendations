  "description": "[b]Junjou Romantica:[/b]\r\nTakahashi Misaki is suddenly having some unexpected and odd problems. What started as a need for some college entrance exam tutoring has somehow led him to being romanced by a suave older man who also happens to be his big brother's best friend. Confused by all of these brand new emotions, Misaki struggles to deal with his suddenly very odd life. And if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, his suitor, Usami Akihiko, has plenty of issues of his own. A man-child who decorates his room in giant teddy bears and toys, Usami is a famous novelist who also writes steamy boys' love novels on the side. When Misaki cracks open one of these books and reads sentences like &quot;Usami licks every inch of Misaki&rsquo;s hot body&quot;&hellip;well, let&rsquo;s just say that all hell breaks loose.\r\n\r\n[b]Junjou Egoist:[/b]\r\nKamijou Hiroki is a broken man, consumed by unrequited love for his childhood friend, Usami Akihiko. Along comes Kusama Nowaki &ndash; whose name &quot;Nowaki&quot; means &quot;typhoon&quot; &ndash; an orphan working his way through life since middle school. Like the typhoon he is named for, he whirls into Hiroki's life and his heart, blowing all resistance away before him.\r\n\r\n[b]Junjou Terrorist:[/b]\r\nAs fate would have it, Miyagi Yoh &ndash; whom Hiroki is working for, as assistant professor &ndash; and Takatsuki Shinobu, a high school student, cross paths. Bits and pieces start to link together from the first two stories. That aside, Miyagi, who has a sad hidden past involving a relationship with a teacher, is faced with Shinobu, who just says whatever is on his mind. The wheel of destiny is beginning to turn once again...\r\n\r\n[b][u]Polish / Polski:[/u][/b]\r\n[spoiler]Junjou Romantica\r\nMisaki stoj\u0105c przed rozpocz\u0119ciem studi&oacute;w natrafia na niezwyk\u0142e problemy.\r\nNowy korepetytor Usami Akihiko, b\u0119d\u0105cy tak\u017ce najlepszym przyjacielem jego brata,\r\nokazuje si\u0119 by\u0107 wielbicielem pluszowych misi&oacute;w oraz pisarzem powie\u015bci typu Boys Love.\r\nPewnego dnia Misaki czyta w jednej z jego ksi\u0105\u017cek scen\u0119 erotyczn\u0105, w kt&oacute;rej jeden\r\nz bohater&oacute;w ma takie samo imi\u0119, co on i nerwy ch\u0142opaka w ko\u0144cu nie wytrzymuj\u0105&hellip;\r\n\r\n\r\nJunjou Egoist\r\nHiroki jest za\u0142amany.
