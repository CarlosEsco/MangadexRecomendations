But her dedication was rewarded with betrayal. At the brink of death, the one who extended a helping hand was her arch nemesis, the righteous Grand Duke Cedric.\r\n\r\n&quot;Devise a plan.&quot;\r\n&quot;&hellip;&quot;\r\n&quot;I can't think of anyone else who could turn the tables in this situation, Lady Rozan.&quot;\r\n&quot;&hellip;&quot;\r\n&quot;Lend me your strength.&quot;\r\n\r\nIt wasn't possible to restore the balance of power for an empire that was already falling into ruin, but there was a way&hellip; to turn back time before everything went wrong.\r\n\r\nWith her blood and tears, she sacrifices her own body to cast ancient magic in order to turn back time.\r\n\r\nThis time, she wouldn't fail.\r\n\r\nReturning back to her 18-year-old self, Artezia resolves to become the villainess for Grand Duke Cedric.\r\n\r\n&quot;Please ask for my hand in marriage. I will make you the Emperor.&quot;",
