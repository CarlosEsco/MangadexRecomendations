  "description": "From the author of [url=https://mangadex.org/manga/6002/]The World is Mine[/url].\r\n\r\nA young, unemployed, seemingly unmotivated young man is moving through his life. As a teenager, he and some of his friends formed a &quot;Boyz 4 Men&quot; club, which was based on a hatred of sex and women. As arguably the most opinionated member, his view of sexuality as an adult is far from normal. After a highly sexual encounter in a park at night, he has decided to attempt to draw perverted fetish manga. This brings him once again to the presence of a woman from the park, Sawada Kazumi. She's a manga editor and single mother with a perverted and intense personality of her own. What will happen when their worlds collide?",
