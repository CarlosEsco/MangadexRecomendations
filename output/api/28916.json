  "description": "Getto has always tried to get his father's attention, but it seems his father is more interested in his AI robots. When Getto graduates from high school, his father sends him P-02, an AI, as a congratulations gift. Not only that, but P-02 was told by the professor that Getto was his &quot;best creation ever&quot;. In hearing that, he is determined to find out why and to take that title for himself. When the two meet, there's some confusion, but they quickly learn that the most important being in their lives might just be each other.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Polish / Polski:[/u][/b]\r\n[spoiler]Zakocha\u0142em si\u0119 w androidzie.
