  "description": "In the near future, aliens from Bluto &ldquo;invade&rdquo; the Earth. But what is their objective? To steal all of the timed sale groceries at rush hour and make perverted havoc among the citizens. Not the kind of aliens you would find every day. To counteract this &ldquo;terrifying&rdquo; enemy, a special force of heroes, &ldquo;The First Star Heroes,&rdquo; has been sent out wearing dynamic colors. But, out of the five heroes, two of them have a secret. Momose Kaname, a 14 year old boy who has idolized these heroes, is transformed into the team&rsquo;s Pink Hero and now has to hide his identity. And &ldquo;he&rdquo; finds out that the Red Hero of the team is actually a girl who has experienced the same gender-bending transformation as Kaname. What will happen to these Heroes, especially Kaname, as they face all kinds of odds during their &ldquo;heroic&rdquo; days?",
