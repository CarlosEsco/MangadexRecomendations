  "description": "Ekijin (God of Pestilence) Syndrome is a disease that manifests paranormal abilities in an individual that eventually leads to death. The cause is completely unknown and the only remedy is symptomatic therapy. Your family, friends, or even you can be suddenly infected with that disease and become the grim reaper itself. However, there are people who resist and fight against that hopeless disease. They are the Treatment Execution Organization's specialty division, &quot;Ekijin Corps.&quot;\r\n\r\nThough those within the unit are infected by the disease themselves, they wield their paranormal abilities as weapons and put down their lives to rescue the infected. In order to protect the lives in front of them and to win against the disease that will undoubtedly take them in the future, the doctors will fight until the end.",
