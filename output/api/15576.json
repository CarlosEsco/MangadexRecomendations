  "description": "In a world similar to ours, a select few individuals are able to develop extra-ordinary abilities. After a period of chaos and destruction known as &ldquo;The Dark Days&rdquo;, the world nations decided the best way to manage this phenomenal was to create a nation that could monitor and contain these individuals. This nation was called the Almier nation. Individuals with supernatural abilities (known as flame users) have to join the Almier nation and successfully become an Almier before they are allowed back to their normal lives. If they refuse or cannot achieve the status of Almier, these individuals are permanently sealed away from their abilities and can no longer access them.\r\n\r\nA small group of flame users who do not wish to be monitored or contained by the Almier set out to take down the nation. At the same time the Almier Nation decides it can do much more than just monitor extra-ordinary humans. It decides it can help to achieve world peace and begins trying to convince the world of this via diplomatic means.\r\n\r\n[url=https://ronucreative.com/]RON&Uacute; Creative[/url]",
