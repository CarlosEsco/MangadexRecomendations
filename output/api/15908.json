  "description": "Translation from the product page:\r\n\r\nOpen the box to give me light, breath life into me, hold me with your love...then forget about me.\r\n\r\nMaster, I miss you.\r\n\r\nMaster, I love you too.\r\n\r\nMaster, do you remember?\r\n\r\nI'm still lying in that box waiting for you. Waiting for you to open it again, and tell me you love me.\r\n\r\nJiang Ziya returned home to find that the single child in the family had become two and no one seemed to notice. \r\n\r\nZiya has a strange left eye, one that could see what others couldn't. Most of the time, he would ignore it but this time something abnormal is happening in his home. He couldn't possibly turn a blind eye to this, could he?\r\n\r\nThere is no peace in this world.\r\n\r\nSome dangers require just a 'glance.'\r\n\r\nIn the face of unknown, do you choose to see -- reality?\r\n\r\n[b]Note from the scanlator:[/b]\r\nThe artist has said that the manhua will only cover the first two volumes of the original novel, which concludes the case &quot;Human Doll Contract.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe original novel is &quot;Illusions, Lies, Truth,&quot; which is being translated by [url=https://www.mangaupdates.com/groups.html?id=2739]Prince Revolution![/url].",
