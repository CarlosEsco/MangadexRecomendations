But it's his best friend, he can't possibly be in love with him...right?!

However, his dad's new Italian apprentice (who wants to bathe together!) is about to shatter Ibuki's resolve!\r\n\r\n3)\r\nHachiya always felt Hozumi's eyes on him in high school, but never talked to him. Now they meet 8 years later in a gay pub but is it just coincidence? Or destiny?\r\n\r\n4)\r\nTakashina has an imaginary friend name Michael...an imaginary sex friend that is! But he wishes to fall in love with a real man. Maybe his friend Toriumi could be of assistance?\r\n\r\n5)\r\nOkabe is an artist who doesn't go out much. The first man he fell in love with is getting married soon, what is this difficult feeling? In comes Akiyo, a gay janitor who touched one of Okabe's sculptures.
