  "description": "A collection of short stories:\r\n\r\n#1: Ringo Hoppe no Koi\r\nTakami has a HUGE problem! She blushes at the drop of a hat, so everyone knows what she is thinking! She finally makes a decision to stop letting her fear of embarrassment control her -- she gets a job where her crush is working so that she can confess her feelings to him... but then things go awry in an unexpected way!\r\n\r\n#2: Hinatabokko no Heya\r\nTomo and Daisuke have been childhood friends for ten years. Whenever something goes wrong with Daisuke, he finds refuge in Tomo's sunshine-abundant room. When Tomo asks Daisuke for a 'date' with him as her birthday present, will the equations of their relationship change?\r\n\r\n#3: 24 Ko no Kurisumasu (24 Pieces of Christmas)\r\nRio met Ian, the son of her father's friend, during Christmas when she was in the third grade. Ian turned out to be a devil with an angelic smile. That Christmas remains as an irritating memory for Rio, considering how Ian played multiple pranks on her and bullied her throughout the day. After that Christmas, Ian's family moved away to England and she didn't get to see him since then. But Ian sends Christmas cards for her every year. Years later, during Rio's 17th Christmas, Ian is back in Japan......planning some new pranks?",
