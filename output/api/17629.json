  "description": "Nine years ago, while on holiday, Nonozumi Kanata received her first kiss from a boy named Haruka. Now age 15, Kanata has continued to love him and treasures a photograph of them together, which she always carries with her. Finding that she will be spending the Summer Holidays alone, she decides to find Haruka using the address on the photograph as her only clue. As she has never travelled alone before, she nearly boards the wrong train, only to be &quot;saved&quot; by Kasukabe Kairi--a very cute and popular boy from another class at her school. As they travel, she tells Kairi of her dream and he decides to help her in her search! Will Kanata be successful in finding the true &quot;Haruka&quot;? And when she does, will he return her feelings? And what about Kairi who's been helping and protecting Kanata on her journey? The path to true love is never easy.\r\n\r\nDeutsch (Akuma-Corp):\r\nKanata versucht nach unz&auml;hligen Jahren ihre Sandkastenliebe Haruka wieder zu finden, da sie immer noch Gef&uuml;hle f&uuml;r ihn pflegt. Ihr Mitsch&uuml;ler Kairi begleitet sie, doch es scheint, als w&uuml;rde sich was zwischen den beiden entwickeln. Was Kanata blo&szlig; dann macht?",
