  "description": "From Dark Horse:\r\n\r\nWelcome to the future of vast bio-constructed cities with crime so severe that the cops drive tanks! For top tank-cop Leona Ozaki (and her trusty tank, Bonaparte), the day-to-day is a tall order already, but when the villainous and sexy (and super-powered androids!) Puma sisters become duly deputized officers of the law and are assigned to &quot;help&quot; Leona catch Urushi-Maru, &quot;The Skyscraper Pirate,&quot; things are bound to get out of hand, especially in the midst of a full-on, tank-on-tank streetfight between Leona and a corrupt arms manufacturer bent on getting the city's police tank contract! \r\n\r\nNote: This manga is not considered to be part of the same continuity as the original stories",
