  "description": "2016 is an unusual book. It&rsquo;s a book where our characters essentially crossed over to our world today, whereas I make it very clear that the world of Pacific is similar, but not like our own. It has political content, but it&rsquo;s more along the lines of my personal musings on what I believe to be one of the most interesting events of the century. I&rsquo;ve also found that people tend to read whatever it is that they want to see in the book itself, ranging from appreciation and understanding to outright vitriol (from our left-leaning readers) and MAGA! Trump! to utter disappointment (from our right-leaning readers).",
