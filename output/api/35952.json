  "description": "400 years ago, there was a dictator in this country. A story of Tokugawa Iemitsu's boys love and fearful politics! \r\n\r\nTokugawa Iemitsu, the strongest depicted yet wicked shogun. In his twisted love toward boys and men, the man himself ascended politics with fear. 400 years ago, the man in his absolute subordinate-slavery system, reigned as an unparalleled dictator.\r\n\r\n\r\n[*]Artist's Twitter: Imaii Muji [url=https://twitter.com/101_641]  @101_641 [/url]",
