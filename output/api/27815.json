  "description": "In the tradition of &quot;My Antonia&quot; and &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot;, from the pen of the renowned Korean manwha creator Kim Dong Hwa, comes a trilogy about a girl coming of age, set in the vibrant, beautiful landscape of pastoral Korea.\r\n\r\n1. &quot;The Color of Earth&quot;: First love is never easy. Ehwa grows up helping her widowed mother run the local tavern, watching as their customers &ndash; both neighbors and strangers &ndash; look down on her mother for her single lifestyle. Their social status isolates Ehwa and her mother from the rest of the people in their quiet country village. But as she gets older and sees her mother fall in love again, Ehwa slowly begins to open up to the possibility of love in her life.\r\n\r\n2. &quot;The Color of Water&quot;: When Ehwa goes to the town festival, she meets a handsome young wrestler named Duksam who&rsquo;s eager to catch her eye. After he wins the festival wrestling championship, he and Ehwa begin to meet, sneaking spare moments to be together. But a shadow falls on their romance when Master Cho sends Duksam away and asks for Ehwa&rsquo;s hand in marriage himself It is then that Ehwa discovers the pain of heartbreak &ndash; and that love is always complicated.\r\n\r\n3. &quot;The Color of Heaven&quot;: A celebration of the triumph of true love. As Ehwa grew from a girl to a young woman in The Color of Earth and The Color of Water, she began to understand and experience love and relationships, with her mother as a model and confidante. Now, in the heartwarming conclusion to this lyrically written and delicately drawn trilogy, Ehwa's true love comes at last, and as her mother looks on, she takes the final steps towards becoming an adult.",
