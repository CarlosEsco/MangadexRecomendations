  "description": "A collection of stories by Osamu Tezuka, including:\r\n\r\n[*]Kenichi and Shunsaku find themselves shrunk to the size of dust particles and are absorbed into a human body. There they are caught in a battle between tuberculosis bacilli and white blood cell corpuscles. \r\n[*]Hariru, a vegetable man from Mars, is sent to Earth to obtain water. A boy and girl save him from starvation, but the Earth government assassinates him. Before he dies he gives them a golden seed that grows into his child and continues his mission.\r\n[*]Professor Hanamaru creates a time machine that revives a caveman in the present day. Hamegg and others learn of the machine and try to manipulate it, but end up reviving a titanosaur. The caveman defeats the Titanosaur and then lives with Professor Hanamaru.\r\n[*]Prime Minister Marcus Nobemitch appoints the caveman Bugaboga director of the state-operated zoo.The vainglorious prime minister, however, collects so many animals in the zoo that he could not provide them with sufficient food due to lack of budget. Forced to cut down on food, the hungry animals, led by Bugaboga, revolt. Meanwhile, the vice prime minister Crodan attempts a coup d'etat by using bombs in the shape of animals.",
