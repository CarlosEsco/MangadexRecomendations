  "description": "I recovered my past memories when I was hit on the head by a rock. I am Katarina Claes, the eight year old daughter of the duke. In a feverish nightmare, in which the prince&rsquo;s fiancee was determined, I have realized that this is the otome game from the previous life. Also, I have turned into the villainess that interfered with the romance of the capture targets&hellip; If the heroine got a happy end, I would be exiled, while if she got a bad end, I would be killed by the capture target&hellip; I have no happy end!? Why is it only bad!? Somehow I have to avoid the destruction end, and reach old age peacefully!!\r\n\r\n[b]Links:[/b]\r\n[*][url=https://twitter.com/hidakanami]Artist's Twitter[/url]\r\n[*][url=https://ncode.syosetu.com/n5040ce/]Original Web Novel[/url] (Raw)",
