  "description": "Hatori Ejima has a beautiful face and is the idol of his school. But has a weakness: a phobia to all girls due to childhood trauma. To cure him, his sister, Saiko forces him to cross-dress and join her idol fans club. Saiko is the leader of Miya Fans Club of the famous duo, RUSH. Hatori, who can't stand being near more than 2 girls, must now face 200 fan girls at once! Not to mention, the idol Miyato from RUSH seems to have fallen for his female identity!",
