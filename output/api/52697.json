  "description": "[i]Promotion for the novel.[/i]\r\n\r\nWhen I opened my eyes, I found my soul synced into the popular dating sim game, &lsquo;Midnight&rsquo;! And although I was clearly one of the female protagonists, I possessed the body of Evenes Harin, the saint who is treated like a trivial extra. What&rsquo;s worse is that I must pursue one of the five male love interests and see it through to a happy ending in order to complete the game. \r\n\r\nHaving attended the triple combo of an all-girls middle school, high school, and university wasn&rsquo;t enough of a debuff, having unintentionally put up an iron defense, I&rsquo;ve been in &lsquo;forever alone&rsquo; mode for 25 years. On top of that, I&rsquo;ve possessed the Saint seldom played due to her atrociously difficult route! This life is screwed up, and I&rsquo;m sure of it.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;The more you look at it, the more novel this situation is.&rdquo;\r\n &ldquo;...?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;How would you feel about living here like this?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nBoasting a 99.9999% probability of a bad ending: the obviously crazy Archmage.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Evenes Harin.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m sure you serve the devil. Or are you really crazy?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe epitome of rudeness: the seriously narcissistic Crown Prince. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made up my mind.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you into my first doll.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nInstead of wrinkles on his brain, it&rsquo;s full of blooming flowers: the yandere Merchant Union&rsquo;s director.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;...&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;... Do you have something to say?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;[i](shakes head)[/i]&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAt the level of a shadowy human, a man of few words: the underworld guild leader.\r\n\r\nAt the lowest level, the most ordinary one is the empire&rsquo;s youngest swordmaster: the knight commander...\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Lady Saint.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m together with my Lady, my heart feels at ease.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;... Ah.&rdquo;\r\n &ldquo;I feel like I am one with Lunium.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAs you can see, he is a zealous follower of the Temple of Lunium.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Would you not like to visit our house?&rdquo;\r\n &ldquo;... Your house?&rdquo; \r\n&ldquo;There is something that I would like to show you. Only to you.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAnd even the duke&rsquo;s daughter, who can be called the true heroine, is acting like this.\r\n\r\n... Will I really be able to complete this game without any problems?\r\n[hr][url=https://twitter.com/ryoyell]Novel Illustrator's Twitter[/url]",
