  "description": "A collection of Sailor Moon doujinshi featuring Haruka &amp; Michiru.\r\n\r\nIn &quot;Sweet Soul Revue,&quot; by Miike Romuko, Haruka brings some cake over to Michiru's place, and they fool around.\r\n\r\n&quot;Drifting Off to Sleep...&quot; by Yuukawa Risa focuses on Haruka's thoughts about Michiru's sacrifice in the middle of the third season.\r\nAkasaka Arika's &quot;Season of Endings&quot; deals with Haruka and Michiru's regret that they can't be with Sailor Moon.\r\n\r\nIn &quot;Losing and Finding Things Everyday,&quot; by Etou Atsuki, Michiru and Haruka talk about their future.\r\n\r\nIn Matsukaze Satori's &quot;Sortilege,&quot; Michiru thinks about her dreams.\r\n\r\nKomedawara Gonzaeko's &quot;How Many Times Must I......&quot; is about a tender moment between Michiru and Haruka.\r\n\r\nIn &quot;Where the Wind Is,&quot; by Oowa Takumi, Haruka explains to Makoto and Ami how kindness can in fact be cruel.\r\n\r\nIn &quot;Messiah,&quot; by Ginga Natsuka, Haruka reflects on her own personal Messiah.\r\n\r\nIn &quot;Holiday,&quot; by Tenoh Saya, Haruka finds a motorcycle and decides to fix it up. (Note: The end of the story refers to a &quot;part 3,&quot; but there was never one published in the Crystal Planet's Haruka and Michiru anthologies. If one exists, it is in one of the artist's own doujinshi.)\r\n\r\nLinks to The Doujinshi &amp; Manga Lexicon:\r\n[url=https://www.doujinshi.org/book/307399/Crystal-Planets-Haruka--Michiru/]Volume 1[/url]\r\n[url=https://www.doujinshi.org/book/1600514/]Volume 2[/url]",
