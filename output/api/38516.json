  "description": "From Nakama:\r\n\r\nThree men bearing tattoos are Peony Katagi, Buttercup Mutou, and Mad Shark Nogami. They are all involved in some way with mystery man Kubota. Is there salvation for these men who live on the underside of society?\r\n\r\nIn the final part of the tattoo series, &quot;Everyone's Song,&quot; forty-two pages drawn specifically for the occasion, all the stories come to a conclusion.\r\n\r\nTwo extra stories are included in this collection. In &lsquo;Spring Love&rsquo;, the object of a man's one-sided love turns into a vengeful spirit every night and visits him. &quot;Dream's Guidance&quot; has also been added to this special collection.",
