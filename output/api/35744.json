The morning after he does the deed for Seki, the guy denies remembering anything. He was drunk last night, but he apologizes and pays anyway. How dare he apologize! Kusuo is just like every other whore... so why is he treating him like this? He is angry and confused, and leaves with the money. \r\nBut soon their paths will cross again.Throw in a violent pimp and best friend who secretly loves Seki and things get complicated. How will these two completely different people affect each other's lives?\r\n\r\n4) Koi no Okite extra: His Sadness\r\nHonda, Seki's best friend, will always hold onto their friendship...\r\n\r\n5) Additional story: Glass Fruit\r\n\r\n6) Koi no Okite extra: The Law of Hosting.\r\nThe story of Kusuo and an apron.
