A cheerful security guard enters his life, but even he finds Shingo's violent mood swings too much to handle.\r\n\r\n6: Tsurete Itte Kure (Take Me With You)\r\nShimizu takes care of his former boss Chiba, who is struggling to cope with a marriage breakdown, unemployment and a drinking problem. But are his motives purely altruistic?\r\n\r\n7: Memorial Day\r\nA widowed assistant director is desperate to find a birthday gift for a favorite employee.",
