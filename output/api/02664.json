  "description": "Hayama Sonata has been a pro golfer for 2 years, but she has never played in a pro golf match. It's because she doesn't have a sponsor to pay for the cost of a match. One day a weird president of a company comes to make a contract of sponsorship with her. The requirement for the contract is that Hayama must do cosplay in her matches. Can she become a real pro golfer and beat all her opponents?",
