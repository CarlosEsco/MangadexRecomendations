  "description": "A collection of several absolutely intense and violent stories. They are gorey and crazy. The first is about a woman who has mantis-like arms and uses them to sever heads, and then in turn uses those heads for her own special purposes... Read to find out. The same main character is used throughout. If you love murderous koala bears, read!",
