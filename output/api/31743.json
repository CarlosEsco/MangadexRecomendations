  "description": "Touka is an ordinary high school girl who loves bowling. Her father runs a bowling alley, she has a crush on her former coach, and she is a pro at the game. \r\n\r\nThe only issue is that if anybody watches her bowl, she becomes extremely conscious of her body and plays poorly. To ensure this doesn't happen, Touka's best friend tries to help her overcome her shyness while bowling.",
