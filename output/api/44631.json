Booting up this high-functioning robot turns Riko's calm and mundane life upside-down! Although she finds him annoying, the more she watches him, the harder it gets to turn him off... Then, one day, the curious and rather touchy-feely Akito says... &quot;Can kissing convey my love for you?&quot;...What's with this robot? Turns out he has a secret function...!",
