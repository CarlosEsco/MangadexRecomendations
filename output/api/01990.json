  "description": "Shiraishi Yayoi was a relatively unremarkable school girl, although a little clumsy, before a experimental accident changed her life forever. She was forced against her will by her father, self-proclaimed genius physicist, Shiraishi Sensei into a teleporter with a cat , and like in the movie &quot;The Fly&quot;, she combined with the cat.\r\n\r\nNow, whenever she gets excited about anything, a pair of cat ears and a tail pop into existence. In the &quot;catgirl&quot; form, she has super powers, but the major drawback is that she also behaves like a cat when presented with the proper stimuli, like the sight of mice. She also has a boyfriend, but her &quot;problem&quot; tends to interfere in their dates since her excitement inevitably leads to her transformation into a catgirl.\r\n\r\n[hr][b]Note[/b]: There seem to be three editions. Mangaz (free low-quality raws supporting the author through advertisement, see &quot;Raw&quot; link) provide the first one (Kodansha, 1989). The English scanlation switched back and forth between the 1996's Kodansha deluxe edition (with chapters arranged differently) and the 1989 edition (hence the very weird numbering below). Finally, Amazon and Bookwalker sell the digital reedition by Group Zero, from 2018.",
