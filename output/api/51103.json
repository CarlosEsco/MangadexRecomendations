  "description": "A detective named Fujishima lives for his job. One day, he befriends his neighbour, Gojyo Mitsuru, who just moved into his apartment. Fujishima can't seem to leave Gojyo alone, because Gojyo is a clumsy blockhead who can't even throw away trash properly! Fujishima thinks that Gojyo, who slowly becomes dependent on him, is cute. But then someone who knows Gojyo appears all of a sudden, bringing a twist into their budding relationship~!",
