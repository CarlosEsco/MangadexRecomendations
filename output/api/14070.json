  "description": "Ryouma Muroto secretly has feelings for his childhood friend Mao Manaka, a 15-year-old girl who appears to be a refined beauty on the outside, but she's actually an impulsive girl who is very persistent once she has made up her mind to do something, which Ryouma likens to a bulldozer. This personality causes others her age to tend to stay away from her, and Ryouma enjoys the fact that he's basically the only person who can hang around her.\r\n\r\nRyouma's daily interactions with Mao change one day when she meets Hayato Honjou, a fledgling actor who has had trouble making a name for himself in the entertainment industry. Ryouma quickly notices a change in Mao's demeanor when she starts showing a lot of interest in Hayato's up-and-coming career. Mao soon tells Ryouma that she has feelings for Hayato, and she shows Ryouma her determination to get closer to Hayato by joining a talent agency and moving to Tokyo. When Ryouma is later scouted by a talent agent, he decides to chase after Mao in the hope that their paths will connect someday.",
