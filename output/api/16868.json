  "description": "In the 13th century, the Mongolian Empire rapidly expands across the globe. Later historians who studied the prophecies of Nostradamus would say that Mongolia was the birthplace of the &quot;Great King of Terror,&quot; Angolmois. And at last, the force of the Mongolian Empire would turn their attention toward Japan... 1274: The Bun'ei Invasion. The exiled samurai Jinzaburou Kuchii is in Kamakura when he finds himself face to face with this invasion.\r\n\r\nThis story is a fresh look at the great battle that rocked all of medieval Japan: the Mongol Invasion. It shows how the people of Tsushima panicked, struggled, and eventually rose up against the overwhelming forces of their enemy.\r\n[hr][b]Links:[/b]\r\n[*][url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=20771]Anime on ANN[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=https://www.aladin.co.kr/shop/wproduct.aspx?ItemId=189251342] Official Korean [/url]",
