  "description": "Narumi Tsukasa is a bit expressionless and gloomy, yet had always loved ballet and constantly spies on the advance class to watch Haruka practice from outside the window. It just happened that one day, Narumi overheard Haruka refusing to be Hayashi Eichi's partner for the school contest. Upset about it, he said, &quot;If I can't danced with Haruka, then it won't matter who's my partner!&quot; and grabbed Narumi who was just right outside the window. Now the biggest challenge for Narumi is to find her own way of dancing that is different from Haruka's dancing",
