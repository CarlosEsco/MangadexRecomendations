  "description": "A recluse becoming Queen?! In a contest for the throne with scions of noble families, I&rsquo;ll do everything in my power to avoid getting embroiled in it!\r\n\r\nIn the Kingdom of Lindtor, renowned for being governed by a wise ruler, I, Francesca, am the King&rsquo;s granddaughter \u2015 a homebody who delights in chess and staying indoors. However, in the wake of my grandfather&rsquo;s sudden demise, it&rsquo;s revealed that he nominated me in his will as a Queen candidate. \r\n\r\nWhile I was stricken with panic, several young noblemen competing to become sovereign appeared before me: the radiant yet overbearing Stewart, the highly intelligent Cyan, and the captain of the knights, Irvine. &ldquo;Please choose the King from amongst them!&rdquo; I struggle hard against it, but my efforts are futile.  Furthermore, \u300cI pledge my allegiance to you, my Queen.\u300d Is that supposed to be an oath, or a marriage proposal?\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;ll get back my peaceful and tranquil days! \r\n\r\nWhat will result from this shut-in princess&rsquo; desperate resistance\u2015\u2015?",
