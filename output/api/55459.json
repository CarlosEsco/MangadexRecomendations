  "description": "From Renta!\r\n\r\nI'm Yuzu Hayami, a college student who lives on his own. Today, I had a hectic day at my part-time job and had to do a bunch of overtime, and then on my way home, I hurt my ankle, got mugged while I was passed out, and had this drunk old man try to have his way with me because he thought I was turning tricks...\r\nThis guy who was walking by saves me, but it turns out he's a club host, the likes of which I despise...\r\nSince I couldn't walk well due to my injury (it's light, though), I asked him to help me back to my apartment, but... huh? A vacant lot? ...Why?\r\nWhat happened to my apartment!?",
