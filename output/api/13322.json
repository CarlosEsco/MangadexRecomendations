  "description": "The society has changed just as the times it lives in. Now that life-expectancy had dropped to somewhere around forty years families are only allowed to raise one child. If they have more, the parents must make a hard choice and hand one over to the church which offers them for adoption to childless couples. And thus the word &quot;sibling&quot; was eventually lost. But perhaps some of those separated children will find their ways to one another.",
