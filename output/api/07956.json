The things that drove the elements, the things that drove the energy and many things were divided. In this world called for twins constantly, and within it, there was time floating with the world of elements imbued with one another. The buoyancy and spirit guides, acted under the power of the gods most powerful to demonstrate the balance of power, the moon, the axis that supports it. Either way, these orders are completely unknown to welcome the world beyond. There is an old story about the two moons, the imbalance between the twins and the two warriors that will come with grace.
