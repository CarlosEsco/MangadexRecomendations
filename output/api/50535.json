  "description": "I was reincarnated as a supporting character in a novel. And on top of that, I had the role of a &lsquo;magpie bridge&rsquo; inside the romance story &lt;Hestia&rsquo;s Boys&gt;.\r\n\r\nAnyways, romance was impossible, and my future seemed bleak with my debt-riddled family. After becoming a civil servant, I tried to enjoy the wealth and honor I couldn&rsquo;t have in my past life, but&hellip; Unlike the originals, the male characters seem kind of strange?!\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Imagine, how would Char-Char look blushing and shy while looking at someone she likes?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Wow&hellip;.. that&rsquo;d be amazing.&rdquo;\r\nKeurigord gets blank-stared, Hylli wants to talk whenever we see each other, and Yves wears an expression and mutters to himself.\r\n&ldquo;Should I take you and run away&hellip;.&rdquo;\r\nSean would cover his face with both hands without saying anything. His blush used to only reach his face but now the red spreads to the tip of his ears.\r\n\r\nWhy are you guys not obsessing over the female lead and doing other stuff instead?\r\n\r\nCharine West, who wanted to live a normal life, and her survival at Char-Char&rsquo;s reverse harem.",
