  "description": "&ldquo;Jeez&hellip; Going into heat in a place like this&hellip;&rdquo;\r\n\r\nI hate this, but I can&rsquo;t stop my instinctual desire&hellip; I can&rsquo;t believe that this first-rate, yet horrible man is my fated match&hellip;\r\n\r\nNiikura Wakana is a romance writer who can&rsquo;t sell. Her editor recommended an assignment to her: interview the &ldquo;first-rate alpha (&alpha;) male,&rdquo; the young leader of the Koukyou yakuza group, Tatara Kunimitsu, for a magazine article! To get closer to this beautiful man of mystery, Wakana poses as a hostess for a high-end club, but she can&rsquo;t stop sweating from her nervousness&hellip; or so she thought, but in reality, she was experiencing her first heat! Bewildered by the awakening of her omega (&Omega;) traits and unable to control or restrain her aching body, Wakana&rsquo;s pheromones attract a large group of men&hellip; In this desperate situation, the one who comes to the rescue is&hellip;?! Is this feeling love, or is it simply animalistic instinct&hellip;?",
