  "description": "This false love feels better than a kiss, and more exciting than sex. He is tall, he is handsome, and he is kinder than any other person. The ideal high school boy, Minato, is incredibly popular. When faced with a confession in his part-time job of the Futaba student of XXX school, he was not even surprised. However, Minato knew that this meeting was not &quot;just a coincidence&quot; for him.",
