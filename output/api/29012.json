  "description": "Izaki is a young lad who loves cakes. He currently works in a cake shop, which he deems has &quot;flavor that is unrivaled!&quot; But, Takara, the p&acirc;tissier who makes the cakes is an abnormally unsocial guy. Since Takara is the son of the world famous p&acirc;tissier, he completely distrusts others because he is used to being compared to his father and being used by others.\r\n\r\nTakara is completely charmed by Izaki who honestly tells him: &quot;I have no interest in you, but the cakes that you make are superb!&quot;\r\n\r\nTakara confesses his feelings to Izaki, but instead Izaki is completely turned off by it&hellip;!?",
