  "description": "Yukko had always felt that she has a hard time trying to express what she really feels and thinks about the people around her. She wants to sincerely praise her friend and express how good she was on her music recital but all she can say was, &quot;Amazing,&quot; which she thinks is rather shallow. It just didn't sit right with her. On her way home contemplating about all this, she comes across a bizarre shop that might change her perspective and help her grow.",
