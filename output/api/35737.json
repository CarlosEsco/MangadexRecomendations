  "description": "Google Translate : Once upon a time, I was a devil. Yusuke Saito has lost all of his previous memories after disappearing for half a year. A huge amount of past sins stand in front of him, who spends his days reconciling with himself who has no real feeling. The &quot;self&quot; that was informed is a distorted lie.
