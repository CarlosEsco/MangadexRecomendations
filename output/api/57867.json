  "description": "Somehow, before the appearance of the female lead, I became the male lead&rsquo;s temporary wife. Since things had already turned out this way, I decided to try my very best. However&hellip;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so fortunate that someone like you became Cedric&rsquo;s partner.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;ll admit it. It&rsquo;s a fortune that you were the one to become his wife, Dylan.&rdquo; \r\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a fortunate chance that you were the one to become the Lady of the Brighton House.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&hellip;I think I did too much of a good job. \r\n\r\nWhen Cedric&rsquo;s destined partner arrives, I will have to leave. What should I do? To someone like that, Cedric had said this. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Would you have ever thought that the one I would fall in love with would be you?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&hellip;Would you still say the same to me after the real female lead, Adeline, makes her appearance?",
