  "description": "I passed out after a day filled with misfortune. When I later opened my eyes, I was inside my favorite novel. \r\nUnfortunately, I was reincarnated as the villainess who was ruined after wreaking havoc due to her obsession with the male lead...\r\n\r\nThat doesn't matter!\r\nI won&rsquo;t become a villainess, and will instead match my favorite character in this novel, the second male lead, with the heroine!\r\n\r\nBut this is... harder than I imagined?!?!\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo;\r\nThe captain of the knights who was supposed to be the heroine's bodyguard ended up as my own.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I got it for free on the way here. Eat it.&rdquo;\r\nThe guy who is supposed to help the two end up together keeps going off track by 3000%.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Are you out of your mind? I told you to be careful!&rdquo;\r\nAnd the male lead who is supposed to hate me is annoyingly hovering around.\r\n\r\n&rdquo;I'll feed you, Lia!&rdquo; \r\nEven the heroine had no interest in anyone, not even the original male lead?!\r\n\r\nNot only that!\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Thank you. I'll treasure it.&rdquo; \r\nMy heart started beating for Ain who suddenly appeared without warning!\r\n\r\n...Will Lia be able to save the second male lead's love?\r\n[hr][i]Note: This is a oneshot promotional manhwa for the novel of the same name. Additionally, an otome game also based off the novel is already out [/i]",
