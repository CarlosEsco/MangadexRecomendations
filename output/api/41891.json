  "description": "Scarlett was a happy girl. With beautiful looks, a wealthy family, and even a kind fianc&eacute;, Scarlett was expected to be the most beautiful bride in the world. But on the morning of her wedding day, the pure-white bride was killed by someone. When she opened her eyes again, everything was different. \r\n\r\n&quot;I've told you many times before. It's because I'm Scarlett Antwerp!&quot; \r\n\r\n&quot;I'm sorry, but the Esteemed Daughter of the Count, Lady Entwerp, is already dead.&quot; \r\n\r\nWaking up in a strange place, Scarlett could not understand what had happened to her. Why couldn't anyone recognize her? Why was her fianc&eacute; standing next to another woman? Why was she Vivian instead of Scarlett, the Esteemed Daughter of the Count? Why was the one next to her not her fianc&eacute; Edward, but Alexis, the police chief? Scarlett swore that she'd get her fianc&eacute; back and get revenge on the one who killed her.",
