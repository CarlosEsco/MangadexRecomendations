  "description": "Naive young Gabriel Stumbles into a Universe governed by the Hierarchy of the Orders of creation. The species of Gods being the 6th order, rule over the 7th and 8th (humans) order and the entire universe with an iron fist. Having memories of his home on earth stolen from him, he now has to find a way to end this Order of Tyranny. But with 1000&#39;s of leagues of Gods in his way to the top, the race to the throne has begun. Little does he know, he doesn&#39;t belong to either of the 3 orders of creation. Will he claim the throne and change the future or will HE be the one to destroy the future that he sought to save.",
