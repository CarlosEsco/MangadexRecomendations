  "description": "It's the beginning of a new era in the Egypt of pharaohs, the marriage of the young Hatshepsut to her half-brother Seti ensures his rise to Pharaoh, under the name of Thutmose II. Ambassadors of the gods on Earth, they shine to their people and seem at first glance like the perfect couple. However, under her mask of a perfect wife, Hatshepsut hides a deep rage... She doesn't want to accept the restrictions others try to place on her as a woman, she wants to become the Pharaoh, like her father!\r\n\r\nLoosely based on the actual [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatshepsut]historical figure[/url].",
