  "description": "Due to a halfhearted and immature decision made by her mother, Irie was set up to marry the son of her mother&rsquo;s friend. This all began starting when she was 5 years old. She and the boy grew up together until Kang moved overseas due to his father&rsquo;s job. After 10 years, Irie and Kang are reunited when they are 22 and 18, respectively. Can they be a good match for each other despite the four year age gap and their strikingly different personalities, tastes, and ways of thinking, notwithstanding the sour note that they left their relationship on when they were little?",
