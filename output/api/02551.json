  "description": "[b]Kiss to Koukai (Kisses and Regrets)[/b]\r\nThe distance between us wouldn't diminish. It's painful, lonely, and my heart squeezes in pain. At that time, if I had been more honest, would it change anything...? Yeah, right. That's why this time, so I won't regret it, I'll...\r\n\r\n[b]Itoshii no Senpai-sama (Beloved Senpai-sama)[/b]\r\nHinako is the only girl to receive special attention from Katsuragi-senpai, the popular Kyuudo club president protected by his male club-member guards from all girls, not just fangirls. But Hinako's preferential treatment resembles nothing so much as a senior's spartan training of a junior. At first happy over how Katsuragi-senpai diligently takes time to teach her &quot;many things,&quot; Hinako later questions why her so-called enviable position saddens her.\r\n\r\n[b]Ikenai Koto (Something I Shouldn't Do)[/b]\r\nYui vehemently refuses to have her little brother's friend Haruka stay over at her house for the three days his parents are away...\r\n\r\n[b]Kimi no Button Kudasai (Give Me Your button)[/b]\r\nYuki plays pranks on Tomoya because she likes him. Her last one before they graduate: writing Suki (I like you) on the back of his gakuran's second button. What is Yuki supposed to do when Tomoya says &quot;Yes&quot; to another girl before graduation?\r\n\r\n[b]Kieta Hanbun, Nokotta Real (Half Gone, Love Remains)[/b]\r\nA broken school festival sign and a common love for music makes best buds out of Naru and Yamato. That is until Naru loses all hearing in her right ear and she keeps her condition from Yamato a secret...\r\n\r\n[PL]    Dziel\u0105cy nas dystans si\u0119 nie zmieniejszy. Ta \u015bwiadomo\u015b\u0107 sprawia, \u017ce moje serce bole\u015bnie si\u0119 kurczy i usycha z samotno\u015bci. Czy na pewno nie mog\u0119 nic z tym zrobi\u0107? Mo\u017ce jest nadzieja?
