  "description": "From Tadanohito:\r\n\r\nThis is a one-volume series of humorous stories about the affairs of a pair of sisters that work at a hospital. It's all pretty vanilla stuff with well drawn bodies and humorous situations, and pokes fun at the ero-manga genre a little too. The writer (not the artist) is the same person who's worked with Izayoi Seishin.",
