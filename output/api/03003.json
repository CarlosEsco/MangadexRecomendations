  "description": "In the year 1587, the Tokugawa clan is vigilantly looking for a way to destroy Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Hideyoshi depends on the resourceful, intelligent samurai Sanada Yukimura to help him protect his people and foil the plots of his enemies. He has also assigned the loud-mouthed, impetuous shinobi Sarutobi Sasuke to work with Sanada, to their mutual annoyance. Though they may hate each other, they're going to have to work together for Hideyoshi's sake!",
