  "description": "Things seem to be going well between Yoomin and his longtime crush, Seula, the hottest girl in school. But she&rsquo;s only playing nice and actually has a twisted agenda in mind. As if that&rsquo;s not complicated enough, a blast from Yoomin&rsquo;s past is trying to get in his pants by using any means necessary (including jumping out of a motel window to chase him down the street). Don&rsquo;t let pretty looks fool you&mdash;these ladies are sweet but psycho.",
