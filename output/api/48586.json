  "description": "Takumi was an ordinary high school boy who, one day, was diagnosed with a near-fatal disease. As luck would turn out, though, he was able to get a cure. The only issue is that a side effect was changing his gender. \r\n\r\nThis is a ShindoL series, so I don&rsquo;t think I need to go into what happens next. Especially for this classic of a series.",
