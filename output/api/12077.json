  "description": "One man and one act can change the world. That man is Seto Hajime, and the act is prostrating himself on the ground. This simple act can change so many important things. It can save a girl from the yakuza or convince a stubborn chef to change his time-honored menu. Seto will also use his ability to affect change in his work as a high school teacher. After encountering Seto and his overwhelming humility, the world will never be the same!",
