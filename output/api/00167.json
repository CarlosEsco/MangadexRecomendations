  "description": "Anjuu Sendou is a nice girl who just started her first year in the Seiryuu Academy Middle School. She is currently living away from home as a boarding student with her pet named Lime. Her father is a sorcerer and her mother is an expert in chinese kenpo. They are both famous, especially her mother who is called Dragon Momoka. Because of her mother&rsquo;s fame the executive committee wants Anjuu to join the student council. But the council&rsquo;s president thinks that she is a weak girl, so to prove him wrong she decides to catch the school thief. But when things get harder, she wishes to become stronger. So her pet suddenly transforms into a small child with wings (it can&rsquo;t transform into a dragon yet, because it&rsquo;s only a child) and tells her about her power. During a second assault from the thief, Anjuu, with the help of Lime, transforms into a new Saint Dragon Girl, defeating the enemies and becoming the school&rsquo;s protector. Will the student council&rsquo;s members find out the true identity of the &ldquo;warrior&rdquo; girl? Will Anjuu be able to keep her secret?",
