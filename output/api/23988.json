Accordingly, it was devised that man and beast would be genetically combined to oppose those who commit heinous crimes: this new race with multiple strength increases were called &quot;Newmans.&quot; From there, that technology was further utilized, and artificial life forms called &quot;Newmanoids&quot; were produced.\r\n\r\nIncluded one-shots in Volume 2: Bed no Naka no Armageddon (Armagedon Inside the Bed), Neko to Oni-san, Ganbare Konomi-chan, Princess Education!\r\n\r\nSource: MU",
