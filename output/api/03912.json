  "description": "Asuka helped someone who turned out to be a witch and as thanks she offered him one wish.  He said he had just been put in a women's dorm even though he's a boy.  She misinterprets this, turns his body into a girl, and runs away before he can react.  He must now attend school as a girl and look for the witch in his spare time so she can change him back.",
