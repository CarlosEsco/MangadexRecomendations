  "description": "Strange rumors, mysterious legends, and suspicious corpses...\r\n\r\nHizuki Reiji is, by all accounts, a normal high school Japanese teacher, but he's thrust into the middle of a mystery when he moves to another town for a substitute teaching position. The woman he's replacing disappeared two weeks ago, and rumor has it that the problem child of her class, Magaki Kyoichi, was seen with a blood-stained knife the day before she vanished. The cops are on his trail, but what really happened to Sakuraba-sensei? And how are Hizuki and Magaki involved?",
