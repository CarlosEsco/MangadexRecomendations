  "description": "The sorcerer, Lee, and his apprentice, Ravel, reside in the hills on the outskirts of Gell, a town where many sorcerers dwell. What with Lee steering clear of the town and being rather eccentric, it might not be the most exciting home life, but Ravel fills his days by going to school and learning about magic. But who is Lee, the strict and kind sorcerer, and why is he watching over Ravel?",
