  "description": "The slice of life stories of newborn Yumeko Okiura, her mother Ayumi, and her aunt Kaname. Ayumi and Kaname endure the trials and tribulations of raising a newborn child, such as changing diapers and being awakened at odd hours. Not to mention, the stress of taking care of a baby opens rifts in their relationship. Both Ayumi and Kaname are 18, and the story occasionally reflects back to their time in high school.",
