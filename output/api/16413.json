  "description": "1) Teach Me More\r\nOn her way home from school, Hina is attacked by a pervert on the train! She's too embarrassed to raise her voice, but - she's saved by Kyousuke!? Kyousuke is the hottest guy around, and there's not a single girl who doesn't want him. He pulls Hina off the train, and then... he does more things to Hina than the pervert on the train would have!\r\n\r\n2) A Boy's Suggestion\r\nKana is on a mission of love. How pathetic would it be if a senior like her completed high school without ever having had a boyfriend? That's when Takuya, a freshman with a reputation as someone you don't want to mess with, confidently asks Kana to go out with him. She has misgivings about him being younger than herself, but can she be adult enough to overlook it?\r\n\r\n3) Lewd Melody, Obscene Fingers\r\nYurika has grown so used to doing what others tell her to do that she never realized she was like a caged bird. She accepted it as a matter of course when arrangements were made for her to get engaged to Satoshi, her controlling piano teacher. That is until piano genius and fringe element Hibiki teaches Yurika how to put emotion in her music -- how to fly from her cage -- among other less innocent things...\r\n\r\n4) Teach Me More &amp; More - How the Wolf Feels\r\nContinuation of Teach Me More. Hina and Kyousuke finally go on their first real date, and we learn how the wolf feels about his rabbit...\r\n\r\n5) Haou Airen Side Story - A Tale of Happier Times\r\nKurumi's brief dream of happier times with Hakuron.",
