He's quarantined in the hospital for a while, but when he's released, all seems normal. But soon he's drawn to a man, that bears similar mutations to the rat, and Nagasawa kills him with ease. It turns out that Nagasawa is infected with a disease called &quot;Nightshift&quot; and he's a special case that let's him fight the insane infected, and he's employed by a medical agency to do just that.",
