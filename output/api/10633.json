  "description": "Kei is a super-popular, charismatic model with an attitude. He could have anyone he wanted, but he has his heart set on Nanami, his awkward cousin and roommate! Nanami can be harsh at times, but Kei sees that deep down, he's actually a sweetie who worries about people; he just can't express it. Kei thinks that's just adorable, and he's tried so many times to make Nanami his, but there's a reason his cousin never takes him seriously...! Starved for true love, this ultra-possessive supermodel is both beauty and the beast!",
