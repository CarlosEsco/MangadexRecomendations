  "description": "&quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; met at the paradise-like Northern islands; &quot;A&quot; turns &quot;B&quot; into putty in his hands, using honeyed words and an aggressive attitude, but &quot;A&quot; is actually a selfish player! He wants to have both his fiancee and &quot;pig mouth&quot; at the same time, but this causes &quot;B&quot; to fall into an abyss of pain. Caught in this sad three person relationship, will &quot;A's&quot; final decision shock everyone?!\r\n\r\nCh05-07: IT\r\nA free-spirited and flamboyant high-school surfer, Yuuto, is best friends and best enemies with his 'second-in-command' Iusagi. Together with Aminato and Satori, they form a tight, happy-go-lucky clique. Well, until Yuuto discovers, to his bewilderment, that not only is Iusagi gay, but that Iusagi is into HIM! Of course, all it takes is a little encouragement from Iusagi, and timely interfering from the other two nosy sidekicks for Yuuto to see the 'light'. ^.^",
