  "description": "This one is just plain bizarre. Funny and ecchi, but bizarre. Hanappe is something of a loser. He&rsquo;s no good with women, and some have been known to take advantage of him. After one such incident where he winds up helping in a gun robbery after a woman flashes her breast at him, he goes home to (ahem) relieve himself when two demons pop out of his television set. They are Mephisto (the she-devil) and Ofisto Bazooka (the demon) and they&rsquo;ve come to grant three wishes, but instead the demon assaults his mother, Mephisto piles a ton of money in front of his father and then goes after his sister, and they lose track of things. They decide instead of granting wishes to simply live here.\r\nAs a result of this unplanned madness, Hanappe winds up with the power to make people spontaneously undress and want to have sex with him. He is also given the power to shut this off, but he doesn&rsquo;t learn this immediately. It has consequences far beyond what he imagines though&hellip;\r\nAnd then Hanappe discovers a side-effect; he has untapped strength and abilities.\r\nAnd then it gets weird&hellip;",
