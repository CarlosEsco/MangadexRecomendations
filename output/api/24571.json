  "description": "The Golden Sun 4-Koma Gag Battle is a self-published Japanese manga (doujinshi) released on December 10, 2001 in Japan as part of the Hi no Tama Game Comic Series, published by Kobunsha.\r\n\r\nAs a Yonkoma Manga (literally &quot;4-Cell Manga&quot;), this volume is composed of a collection of four-cell strips authored and illustrated by various artists. A total of eighteen artists contributed to the manga, almost all of which contributed a color page and between five and six pages in monochrome. The volume contains a total of 126 pages, most of which feature two four-panel strips that each involve humor and comedy. \r\n\r\nAs this was published ten months prior to the Japanese release of Golden Sun: The Lost Age, the manga does not feature characters or scenarios exclusive to games released after the first, and thus Piers, Karst, and Agatio are noticeably absent.",
