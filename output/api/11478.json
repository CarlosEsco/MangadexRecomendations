The stranger turns out to be Shinohara Yuki, an old crush and work colleague of Kumiko's who quit 3 years earlier because of an incurable illness, and all he wants is to confess to Kumiko before he dies. Knowing that he'll die soon, Kumiko takes pity on Shinohara, invites him to live with her, and soon becomes his lover. But are her feelings really only pity? And is there something Shinohara's hiding too...?\r\n\r\n2. A Sin to Love You\r\nYuu is the top hostess at an escort club for a reason: she loves getting her guy&mdash;but she loves being in control even more! So when shy and conservative Mochizuki becomes her newest client, his reserved behavior perplexes her. Every night she pulls out her best feminine wiles, so why isn't he falling for her already? In desperation, she drags the hapless &quot;Shin-kun&quot; to a love hotel, where she discovers a very interesting secret about him. Could it be that the tables have turned and now Yuu is the one in danger of falling for Shin-kun? And is that the only secret of the man of her dreams?\r\n\r\n3.

The Deceitful Fingers\r\nWhen homeroom teacher Miyagi's assistant goes on maternity leave, her replacement is the handsome Kiritani Riku.
