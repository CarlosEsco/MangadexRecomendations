  "description": "Taichi, a 2nd year university student had to move for financial reasons to the dorms, sharing a room with his friend Kenji. Initially he was looking forward to the mixed sex dorm but his hopes were trashed by the strict setup and monitoring that was put in place. The rules were clear, no contact with the opposite sex apart from sharing of the communal spaces! One night his roommate vanished and Taichi went out to search for him but as he was exploring the library he stumbled upon something that appeared to be a.... hidden room! A hidden room with mysterious magical powers, where the desires of men and women intersect!",
