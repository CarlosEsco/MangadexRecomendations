  "description": "Beware the red snake! Told from the perspective of a young boy, The Red Snake is a story of the above boy, the house he inhabits, and the forest around his house that stretches on and on. The characters in the story are all mad: his grandfather, who sports a massive growth on his jaw; his grandmother, who believes she is a chicken; his father, who is vicious to the chickens he raises (except for his mother, to whom he provides eggs that so that she can claim she laid them herself); and his sister, whose affection for insects borders on the erotic. The story evolves into a classic nightmare.\r\n\r\nThe Hino Horror series:\r\nHino Horror Volume 1: The Red Snake (\u8d64\u3044\u86c7 Akai Hebi)\r\nHino Horror Volume 2: The Bug Boy (\u6bd2\u866b\u5c0f\u50e7 Dokumushi Kozou)\r\nHino Horror Volume 3: Oninbo and the Bugs from Hell (\u5730\u7344\u866b\u3092\u98df\u3046! \u9b3c\u3093\u307c Jigoku Mushi Woku!
