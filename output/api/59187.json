  "description": "Red is an ex-adventurer who was once the driving force in managing his party. He took care of all the busywork, such as dealing with guild requests and supplies for their adventures. Eventually, the hero declared that he was useless in battle and forcefully expelled him from the party. Having everything taken away from him, he spent his time frequenting a guild's tavern. Eventually, a young adventurer who was in trouble was saved by Red, and she begged him to take her on as an apprentice. As time went on, he realized that he had potential in training adventurers. He decided that his true calling was to be a teacher! This is a story about a jack of all trades instructor and his versatile students that will eventually become legendary adventurers who will take down the Demon King.",
