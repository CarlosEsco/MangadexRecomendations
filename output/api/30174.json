  "description": "Benny Akadou is looking for a fight and she has a good reason. Three days ago, her friend Yoko was kidnapped by the mafia. Now she&rsquo;s looking for answers in the only way she knows how, with her fist. She finds her way into a bar with connections to the mafia and is just one step closer to finding her friend. The only problem is can her experience as a national combative sports tournament champion be enough. Is her fist strong enough to face the trials she&rsquo;ll endure during this bar brawl rescue?",
