  "description": "In Shibuya, Japan, on January 26th, 2016, a dimensional rift opened between Earth and a horrific planet called Dreague.  Our world changed forever that day as hordes of terrifying monsters, that we called Kaijin, began to cross over, and there was seemingly no end to their numbers.  These vile beasts were not much bigger than men, but attacked with ferocity unlike anything on Earth.  Despite the best efforts of the world&rsquo;s armies, the Kaijin invasion spread across the planet like a disease. \r\n\r\nApproximately 400 years later, an estimated 5 billion Kaijin inhabit Earth, with only a fraction of the human race remaining.  Over those 400 hundred years, it was survival of the fittest.  Only the most exceptional from each generation would survive&hellip;and it is believed that for this reason, the newest generation have made an evolutionary jump.  Incredible speed, incredible strength, telekinetic powers, lightning reflexes, and even super dense exoskeleton&rsquo;s are just a few examples of how they evolved.\r\n\r\nA small team of these remarkable humans has formed in New L.A., and decide to head East in search of others like them.  They need all the help they can get as they battle Kaijin and other obstacles, on their way to the rift site in Japan.  Along the way, they also discover that it&rsquo;s not as black and white as good versus evil.  The 2 races have more in common than anyone could have imagined. They&rsquo;re not sure what they&rsquo;ll find in the rift, but one thing is certain&hellip;as long as it stays open, there&rsquo;s no hope of taking back Earth.",
