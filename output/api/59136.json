  "description": "&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not done talking to you, Hyung.&rdquo;\r\nWhat is this asshole jabbering about now?\r\n&ldquo;I don't care how much money your family has -- to freakin&rsquo; look down on and treat a person like a beggar, how do you think that would make me feel?&rdquo;\r\nJeong-in was confused as to whether the person in front of him was the same Jo Seung Hyun he had known up till now.\r\n&ldquo;Seung-hyun, I think you&rsquo;re misunderstanding something, I was just innocently&hellip;&rdquo;  \r\n&ldquo;You sure like acting innocent.&rdquo; \r\nSeung-hyun again pinched his lips. It was only then that Jeong-in realized he was holding back laughter. \r\n&ldquo;....Jo Seung Hyun.&rdquo;\r\nYou and Han Min-woo have even slept together like dogs, that kind of word doesn't suit you. \r\n&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;W-what?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear me? You and Han Min-woo have even fucked like dogs, so I asked how do you have the audacity to say the word innocent? \r\nHe had no choice but to doubt his ears. Jeong-in got goosebumps without realizing it and pulled his head back.\r\n&ldquo;Hyung, you don&rsquo;t even have the basics down.&rdquo;\r\nThere was a wrinkle between Jeong-in's fair eyes. His breath became rough because he could not control his anger. Seeing him in such a state, Seung-hyun grinned. \r\n&quot;&hellip;&hellip;to make a deal, you should have asked me what I wanted first.&quot;\r\n&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;.&rdquo;\r\n&quot;What a fool.&quot;\r\n Bam. Someone seemed to hit his head hard.",
