  "description": "After six years of pointless war between her country, the Kingdom of Ehas, and their neighbor enemies, the Kingdom of Cukda, aged 20, the woman soldier and former petty officer Pauliana Kellenbell has been defeated and captured in a storming attack by the army of another enemy nation, the Kingdom of Acrea, an attack she had personally predicted but fell on deaf ears by her superiors. She has been desperately trying to survive in men's society, but it was all in vain, her noble birthright having been taken away by her family by being sent to war, and having all her efforts crushed down by the fact that she's a woman in the all-male army of Ehas. \r\n\r\nAcrea's young king, Lucius, sees her struggle and potential, and makes an unexpected offer. He dreams of becoming the first emperor to conquer the South continent and its sea. Pauliana swears a life-long allegiance to Lucius for acknowledging her, becoming his knight and most trusted advisor, bestowing her with the name Pauliana Winter. However, in the end, Lucius is just an emperor on the battlefield that had awakened his love for Pauliana!\r\n\r\nOfficial English translation on Comico's [url=https://www.comico.io/pocket-comics]Pocket Comics app[/url]",
