  "description": "Fourteen-year-old Little Mo was bullied and called Godzilla by her classmates. Many years later, Mo realizes that life cannot be changed. What happens, happens. The things she had cared about when she was fourteen make herself look childish in her own eyes, and have become something to laugh at. The things that made her sad and hurt when she was fourteen still invoke a dull ache in her heart today. By reading the notebook of fourteen-year-old little Mo, the Mo of present-day begins to speak and console herself silently. This is a story about growing up and how children become adults.",
