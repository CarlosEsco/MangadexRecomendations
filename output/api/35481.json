  "description": "Hundreds of years ago, 48 sexual positions were created and named. It is the equivalent to the Japanese kamasutra. These moves were likely devised during the Edo period (1603-1868), reflecting the 48 set of moves that Sumo wrestling recognizes. 48 different manga artists came together and created oneshots for each different position. In this first volume, 24 of those positions are featured.",
