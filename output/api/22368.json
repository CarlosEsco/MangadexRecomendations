  "description": "Sang, once the little boy too afraid to jump into the lake with the older children, comes back home a brave new man &ndash; a huntsman, to be exact. It's only after reuniting with his friend Sejin, the shaman&rsquo;s daughter, that he notices a black shadow has been following him... The experience reminds him that there are spirits that walk amongst us, and not always in the dark.",
