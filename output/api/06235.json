  "description": "Kuzumi Akio followed in his dad&rsquo;s footsteps and started playing the violin when he was a young boy. One day at his father&rsquo;s professional orchestra practice, he witnesses a conductor&rsquo;s young daughter, Sonari Hibiki, conduct the professional orchestra while her father is taking a break. Akio and even the other professionals with years under their belt were blown away at how amazing she was able to control the band.\r\n\r\nNine years have passed since that day and Akio is now in music school in college. He feels frustrated at his current skill level and doesn&rsquo;t feel any inspiration. Akio learns that Hibiki is also in the same school and, through her, finds the motivation and music sense that he was lacking his entire life. [vyc]",
