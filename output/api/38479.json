  "description": "&quot;He'll do it with anyone who asks, you know. Even me.&quot;\r\n\r\nHisato, a vampire, has been a foster parent and the centre of affection for Shuri, a university student for the longest time. Hisato will kiss, have sex, even say words of love if one wishes for it, but... Wanting to become the &quot;soulmate&quot; that Hisato has been yearning for, Shuri has been eliminating people getting close to Hisato relentlessly&mdash;the never ending humans who offer their blood and body to Hisato and seek pleasure from getting their blood sucked.",
