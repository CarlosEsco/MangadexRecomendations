  "description": "Intrepid traveler Shin has been to practically every country on the world map, except for the blank space around 500 kilometers away from his homeland. However, the moment he takes a single step forward, he&rsquo;s immediately captured and told that anyone who comes to Oraie can never leave.\r\nAs Shin carves out a place for himself in Oraie, he gets to know more about its young leader Musutia, who bears the responsibility for Oraie&rsquo;s fate and future on his frail shoulders. He also meets Musutia&rsquo;s beautiful retainer Noe, whose duties often entail giving Musutia a &ldquo;healing kiss.&rdquo; But is this just a ritual between master and servant? Or is there potential for it to blossom into anything more?",
