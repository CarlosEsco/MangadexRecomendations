Isn't... he totally an S?!\r\nIn a period when humans and vampires coexist, being sucked by smart and beautiful vampires means having special status. Shion, who is wearied by the blood of tiresome women, is taken by the delicious smell emitted by a plain salary man called Hajime whom he met on the street. However at the time Hajime, a natural M, had his eyes set on Shion's proud attitude and desired &quot;master and dog&quot; play in exchange for blood. It is Shion who keeps refusing his request... However, he becomes aroused by Hajime's words 'my master is just very cute' and without hesitation he lets Hajime embrace him to the point that Hajime gets knocked out?!!",
