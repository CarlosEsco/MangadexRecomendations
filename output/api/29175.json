  "description": "I recalled memories of my past life after Grandfather told me my engagement was annulled. At the same time, I realized this world was the same world as in my favorite shoujo manga. The villainess who exhausted every method possible to bully the heroine&hellip; I reincarnated as that villainess&rsquo; chubby follower. I shook upon remembering the future lined up for her. When the villainess&rsquo; evil deeds came to light, she pinned all her crimes on Britney. I was a character that gets executed.\r\n\r\nTo reliably avoid this, I must not become the villainess&rsquo; follower. As this villainess only keeps those who are exceptionally uglier than her by her side, I may be able to do something if I slim up. For now, let&rsquo;s go on a diet!\r\n\r\n[b]Links:[/b]\r\n[*][url=https://ncode.syosetu.com/n4774dz/]Original Web Novel[/url] (Raw)",
