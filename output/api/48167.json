  "description": "I have become the mother of &ldquo;Einspanner&rdquo;, the antagonist of a novel. I was supposed to be the bad stepmother who abused him as a child and was killed by him when he became an adult. But, when I saw the cute look on his naive and chubby face&hellip; &ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s so cute. He&rsquo;s so young that he looks like he&rsquo;s still sucking on his tiny fingers! How could I ever hurt him?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThis child is so cute that I can&rsquo;t believe that he would become a villain. And so, I&rsquo;ve decided. I will protect him! This way, he will protect me too!",
