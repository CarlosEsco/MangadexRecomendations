  "description": "I have always thought that this normal peaceful everyday life would go on forever.\r\n\r\n---until the day I met with that incident.\r\n\r\nEven if I had a fight with her, everything would be fine if I just apologized.\r\n\r\n---until she was abducted by a huge red dragon that evening.\r\n\r\nAnd, when I realized it, I was in a weird library. At first, I could not grasp the situation, however, soon I found out that library was a magical library with books which hold everything in the World.\r\n\r\nI tried to return to the original World ---where she is in--- however, the World Book I was in was partly destroyed and I could not return. In attempt to protect my own World, to rescue her, I set off on a travel to fix the Book.",
