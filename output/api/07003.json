  "description": "1. Oyayubi Hime\r\nIn Japanese, Oyayubi Hime literally means Thumb Princess, but it is also the name used for the classic fairy tale Thumbelina. Our heroine, Kogami Madoka, is talented at massage (ie, she has magic thumbs), earning her the title of Thumb Princess in a different way than Thumbelina. She?s always giving free massages to her friends and one day she finally gets the chance to massage the boy she likes, Matsuoka. But, he runs away from her like he?s been touched by fire. Rumors say that Matsuoka hates to be touch by girls and he?s even violent about it. Will she be able to melt his heart with her magic fingers?? \r\n\r\n2. Vampire Darling\r\nTorii Anna is a girl with no good qualities... really. Clumsy, bad at studying and sports, and kinda weird. When Anna trips over a guy lying on the ground, he suddenly tells her he needs to drink her blood. Instead of a normal reaction, Anna happily agrees?\r\n\r\n3. Lovadrenaline!\r\nSakura and Kyou are stepsiblings. Sakura has only ever seen Kyou as a little brother, but is that really true? ... what about Kyou? The two teenagers are forced to face their feelings when their parents go on a 5 day trip.\r\n\r\n4. Princess Romance\r\nUeda Lilla is a high-school student looking for a &quot;mature love&quot; - i.e. she's not interested in dudes her age. When her cousin sets her up on a goukon with older (24y) guys, she finds a hottie... but does he feel the same about such a flashy girl?\r\n\r\n5. I always, always liked you\r\nA story about childhood friends, unrequited love, and a new beginning.",
