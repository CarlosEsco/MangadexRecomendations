  "description": "Let's play &quot;True or False&quot;.\r\n\r\nWe're partners. That's true. Partners are more connected with each other than with anyone else in this world, we trust each other our lives. That is true, too. There's no secrets between us... That is a lie. \r\n\r\nI have terrible nightmares from my childhood and a heavy burden of guilt. And how about you? When you touch me with this icy look, with these icy fingers... What kind of lie do you hide from me?\r\n[hr][url=http://www.peanutoon.com/comics.php?comics=1275]Original Webcomic on Peanutoon[/url]\r\n[url=https://www.bomtoon.com/comic/ep_list/A_Lie]Original Webcomic on Bomtoon[/url]\r\n[url=http://www.mrblue.com/webtoon/wt_lielie_wz]Original Webcomic on MrBlue[/url]\r\n[url=https://www.lezhin.com/ko/comic/lie_lie_lie]Original Webcomic on Lezhin[/url]\r\n[url=https://ridibooks.com/v2/Detail?id=840022049]Original Webcomic on Ridibooks[/url]",
