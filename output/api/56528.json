  "description": "Moriyama Seiko seems to have it all. She&rsquo;s pretty, she has a good job, and she has men lining up to ask for her hand in marriage. But she has two problems. One, she loves food, and most people are horrified by the amount she eats. Two, she&rsquo;s in love with her roommate, Umino Nagisa, the only person who accepts her and her incredible appetite. Seiko's been in love with Nagisa since they were in high school, almost a decade, but hasn&rsquo;t been able to tell her how she feels. This is a story about delicious food and disguising your feelings.",
