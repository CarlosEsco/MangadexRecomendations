  "description": "Hirose Goushi has a huge sister complex. So huge, he moves from his home town to Tokyo to attend Myouzen University in order to escape it!\r\n\r\nThree years later, Goushi's little sister Noa shows up and informs him that she's taking the Myouzen University entrance exam and that she will be moving in if she passed. Little does Goushi know, she has a similarly large (if not larger) brother complex.\r\n\r\nRead as Goushi attempts to hide his feelings for his sister, while she purposefully sets him up for failure.",
