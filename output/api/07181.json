  "description": "1) Youth Survival\r\nSummer camping trips are supposed to be filled with joy and laughter, but why is Kiriko so unlucky~~? At first it was that weakling four eyes, Kazuo and cutesy Hana-chan destroying the pork soup, but then they never came back after asking them to go pick up some wild herbs! Oh, fine! So she and Satoru went up the mountains to get them, but who knew they&rsquo;d get lost too?!\r\n\r\n2) Liar Love Letters\r\nWhen Ritsu's boyfriend asks to break up, she complies - only to find that he's angry about it. To make her pay for dumping him so easily, he puts on a bet. Trick Ritsu into falling in love, and win a good amount of money. When she overhears this, Ritsu is determined to shoot down all the boys out to trick her. But what happens when she comes across someone whose lies capture her heart?\r\n\r\n3) Sword and Heart: Dangerous Relationship\r\nWhen you add the Japanese kanji character for heart underneath the character for sword, sword becomes the character for shinobi. Shizuru, when younger, had a crush on her very brave and handsome ninja senpai, and still likes him to this day. Things in her life get a little complicated when other ninjas decide to steal something valuable that her family is taking care of.\r\n\r\n4) Never Dying Crow&hellip;!\r\n&gt; Otokomae! Beads Club side story\r\n(https://mangadex.org/manga/3465)",
