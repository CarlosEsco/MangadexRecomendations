  "description": "Vior is Heaven's top Reaper and he only needs to collect one more soul before reincarnation. But, there's a problem...he can't kill his final target, an attractive man named Alex. Poison, car crashes, whether magic or more, Vior can't harm him. So, Alex makes a proposition: he will hand over his soul if&hellip; Vior can steal his heart. Can the romantically dense Vior make the narcissistic Alex fall for him and become human again?",
