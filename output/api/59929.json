  "description": "It was supposed to be the happiest day of Satoru's life - until his bride left him at the altar for another woman! As he struggles to get his life back in order, it's a good thing his old friend Daichi's always there to look out for him - but is friendship really the only reason why Daichi's keeping him here? Or had Satoru's happiness been right beside him all along?",
