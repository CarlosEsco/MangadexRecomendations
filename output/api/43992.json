  "description": "Lupin the Third and his motley crew return in Shin Lupin III! This time, several of the stories are either brand new or adapted from or to the Lupin Part 2 anime, and the beginning story was even animated by itself several years later!\r\n\r\nLupin the Third is the grandson of the famous literary thief Ars&egrave;ne Lupin, and his partners in crime include the sharpshooter Jigen Daisuke, the stoic samurai Goemon Ishikawa the Thirteenth, and the on-again-off-again lover/enemy Fujiko Mine.  Their goal is to outwit enemies bigger than themselves while nabbing the world's rarest and most important items, while also outwitting the dogged Inspector Zenigata, who's made it his life's work to capture and secure Lupin. In the manga however, his relationship with the titular thief isn't as &quot;respecting to the enemy&quot; as you would expect, as he's attempted multiple times to kill him without shedding a tear! \r\n\r\nWhat kind of sexy exploits will Lupin and his crew get up to next in...Shin Lupin III!",
