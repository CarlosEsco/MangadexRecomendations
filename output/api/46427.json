  "description": "On the outside, King Cat Caf&eacute; looks like a normal cat cafe. But unknown to most, it's actually a special cafe cast with a spell, carrying out the wishes of cats.\r\n\r\nOrdinary university student Yeon Bora stumbles upon the King Cat Caf&eacute; as it's on the verge of closing down, becoming its manager. She begins to listen to the troubles of the cats, helping them fulfill their wishes.\r\n\r\nTranslation from chinese raws: \r\nClearly just an ordinary student, Lu Zhi Zhi unexpectedly signed a temporary contract to become the Cat Cafe's manager in the heat of the moment without forethought?! Saving cafes on the brink of closing down are her specialty,  but also helping kitties fulfill their wishes, isn't this too out of the ordinary?! Even though all the cats in the cafe can turn into first-class handsome guys, she...she still needs a moment to consider it carefully! But can these cats really become cafe staff? The coffee they brew tastes like rag water, the biscuits they bake are hard enough to kill, no wonder there hasn't been any guests the whole day, when will they achieve their goal of establishing a successful buisness?\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n[url=https://page.kakao.com/home/%EC%95%BC%EC%98%B9!-%EB%8F%84%EC%99%80%EC%A3%BC%EC%84%B8%EC%9A%94-%EC%A0%90%EC%9E%A5%EB%8B%98!%5B%EB%8F%85%EC%A0%90%5D/54458711]Official Korean Translation[/url]",
