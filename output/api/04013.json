  "description": "Hanaka has never been able to stay at a specific place for long because of her grandma&rsquo;s crystal ball. After hearing the news that they&rsquo;ll be packing their bags  again, she cried herself to sleep. That night, she heard a sweet harmony and dreamed of sleeping in a flower bed. The next day, when she was on her way to say goodbye to her friend, a trio appeared and identified her as &ldquo;Princess Hanaka.&rdquo; They demanded for the Laga Star which she hasn&rsquo;t a clue about. At the same time, a guy with silver hair and aquamarine eyes appeared confessing his love for her.",
