  "description": "Compilation of manga essays originally published on Pixiv.\r\n\r\nThe personal story of an aspiring mangaka: a 28-year-old college dropout who's led a lonesome, unfulfilling life and who has never had sex or even allowed herself to think about sex outside of reading BL. For many years she's been on the path to self-destruction until she realizes that she needs to begin truly living before it's too late. So, on a whim, she solicits the services of a female sex worker.",
