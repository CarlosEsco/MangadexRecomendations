  "description": "After two hundred years, A young alchemist known as Mariella wakes from her slumber. \r\n\r\nThe Kingdom of Endarisa had been brought to ruin by the stampeding 'Forest of Demons.' Although Mariella managed to escape by using the power of 'Living Death,'  she made a clumsy mistake and ended up sleeping for two hundred years. \r\n\r\nThe age in which she awoke was a completely new world. Here alchemists were all but extinct and potions could only be afforded by the rich and powerful. \r\n\r\nAs a result, Mariella ended up being the only alchemist in the city. Despite this, she still sets out to lead a quiet and leisurely life in this strange new world. Although it's two hundred years in the future, she'll still live life her own way.\r\n[hr][b]Official English Description:[/b]\r\nMariela is the last alchemist alive after waking from a deep sleep that lasted two hundred years. As the sole alchemist in town, she can make a killing from making and selling potions...but after two hundred years of suspended animation, all she wants to do is relax, take things easy, and live at her own pace!\r\n[hr][*]Youtube Promo Videos for the light novel: [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip30XatO6_8]01[/url], [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLXE8LgvYCs]04[/url]\r\n[*]Alternative Raw: [url=https://comic.pixiv.net/works/4254]comic.pixiv[/url]",
