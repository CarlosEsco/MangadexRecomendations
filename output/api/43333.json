  "description": "It is foretold that every 3,000 years the Choujin, or Overfiend will come. This prophesied being will unite the three worlds of the humans (ninjinkai), demons (makai), and the half-human animal spirits (juujinkai). This is support to usher in a period of great peace and prosperity. But, it can be that one demon's peace may not have the same meaning to a human.",
