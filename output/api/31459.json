  "description": "Meet Tsubaki Kuchinashi, the Manhater Prince. Beautiful and popular, Tsubaki's core strength in high school comes from her position as the principal's granddaughter - suffice it to say, but any student or teacher who even looks at her the wrong way could be expelled at a moment's notice. \r\n\r\nMeet Tadashi Kiritsu, the head of the Public Morals Committee. As sharp and rigid as his glasses, Tadashi despises Kuchinashi's iron grip on the school. Naturally, a challenge to her rule bothers Kuchinashi, so she decides to get rid of him as soon as possible. Her plan? Get him in a honey trap. However, that's easier said than done, as she starts finding hidden aspects of herself that she didn't want to acknowledge, either to herself or to Tadashi.\r\n\r\nWill she prevail before her conscience eats her up from her own salacious taunts? Will Tadashi play into her hands? What manner of a person will he prove himself to be when facing her taunts?",
