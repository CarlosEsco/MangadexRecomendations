No one else can save me other than you.&rsquo; \r\n\r\nThese words and the image of his sister screaming those words while approaching him bare-footed remained in his head. Rafael ventures out in search after his relatives for the first time in his life, to attend Mary&rsquo;s funeral.\r\n\r\nBut in the place where they found Mary&rsquo;s body, Rafael finds a note&hellip;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Lift up your face.&rdquo;\r\nWanting to find the killer of Mary, Rafael disguises himself as the new queen consort, Anne-Mary La Shore and meets the king &lsquo;Ivry.&rsquo;\r\n\r\nThat moment marked the start of an unprecedented fate.\r\nThe unexpected end of his sister who wasn&rsquo;t like her younger self, and who he believed would find happiness&hellip;\r\n\r\nWhat was the &lsquo;hell&rsquo; that his sister dropped into?\r\nAnd what will change after Rafael and Ivry meet?",
