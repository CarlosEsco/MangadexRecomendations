  "description": "After the death of Mao's mother, who was called the &quot;Fairy of Cuisine&quot;, Mao must strive to become a legendary chef himself, in order to take the title as head chef at his mother's restaurant. To do this, he must travel across China to learn the many ways of cooking, but he learns that the real battle has only just started. The Dark Cooking Society has already begun to move...\r\n\r\n[b]Ch\u016bka Ichiban![/b] (\u4e2d\u83ef\u4e00\u756a!, lit. Chinese Food Number One!) is a manga created by Ogawa Etsushi.\r\nFrom 1995-1997 it was published as Ch\u016bka Ichiban!. However, during the middle of its serialization, the character '\u771f' was added, so from 1997 to 1999, it was serialized as [b]Shin Ch\u016bka Ichiban![/b] (\u771f\u30fb\u4e2d\u83ef\u4e00\u756a!, Truth - China's Number One!).\r\n\r\nIn 1997, Ch\u016bka Ichiban! was adapted into an anime series directed by Anno Masami of the same name. In some countries, the anime adaptation was called [b]Cooking Master Boy[/b].\r\n\r\nPublished in Indonesia as The Real Master Cooking Boy by Elex Media (2004-2005).",
