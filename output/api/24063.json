Collecting #1-#6\r\nA girl collects everything her crush touches; a man keeps a photo album of women giving him blowjobs; schoolboys plays a sexual card game; a lunchbox factory girl collects vomit; a man gathers his missing girlfriend's body parts; a suicidal girl joins a group of women who've made abortion into a grotesque art.\r\n\r\n7. Harakiri\r\nA world where cutting your stomach is the newest fashionable trend among schoolgirls.\r\n\r\n8. Holy Night\r\nSanta is terrorizing the Japanese by flooding everyone with unwanted gifts. The only way to stop him from sending more is to convince him that you're happy with what you've got, or so people think.\r\n\r\n9.
