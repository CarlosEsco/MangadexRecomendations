  "description": "&quot;A spell to change the genre of your life!&rdquo; Yeah, that&rsquo;d be nice. So far, Juwon&rsquo;s existence has been pretty ordinary: a boring daily routine with zero romance to speak of. Then one day, he sees a movie where the main character&rsquo;s life suddenly turns into a rom-com. Things have been weird ever since. Surely it can&rsquo;t be down to the movie, but&hellip; guys just won&rsquo;t leave him alone! His childhood friend, the cute barista from the coffee shop, his mean classmate, AND his first love?! Four hotties, all at once! Now Juwon stands at a crossroads. Which way will he turn? A new series from the creator of &ldquo;Can't Take My Eyes Off You!&quot;",
