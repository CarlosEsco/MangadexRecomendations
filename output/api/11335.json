  "description": "1-3) Bunbetsu to Takan\r\nAya has a great boyfriend Kento who treasures her a lot. But she is also attracted to Kento's older brother, who has a twisted personality. How come she can't stay away from him and she goes so far to cheat on her boyfriend? Will Aya's sense prevails over her sensibility?\r\n\r\n4) Delusional Diary\r\nUi fell in love with the wrong guy. Jiro is popular and handsome, and agreed to date her, but he insists that their relationship should remain a secret. Ui starts to feel more uncomfortable about her love situation and her trust in Jiro is weakened by his cold attitude towards her. Is Jiro cheating on her or does he just have a very weird way of expressing his love?\r\n\r\n5) The Little Mermaid who Became a Witch \r\nEveryone knows the story of the little mermaid who fell in love with the prince and exchanged her voice for a pair of feet. Did anyone wonder about the witch's story and why was she so bitter towards the young mermaid? An interesting twist of the classic &quot;The little mermaid&quot;, this time, from the witch's point of view.",
