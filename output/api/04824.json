Wakaba always complains about the fact that he&rsquo;s so strict, but at least he&rsquo;s good looking&hellip;\r\n\r\nStory 3: Himitsu no Kinchan! &ndash; by Iwashita Keiko: What would you say if you knew that objects can fall in love?

In her search for a piece of cloth that will fit her she ends up at Aoi&rsquo;s shop, a manager who puts the happiness of the client before the job to sell any cloth to anyone. Will Aoi manage to make Matsumi look beautiful for the party?\r\n\r\nStory 6:  Himikoi ~ Time Limit &ndash; by Robico: It&rsquo;s her last semester of high-school and Mako realizes she hasn&rsquo;t done anything memorable in all her time spent here.
