  "description": "Tomohiro Mikami is a pretty bastardly guy, who is always bitter and hateful. He decides to use some of his &quot;pals&quot; to get the nurse teacher Asou and the language teacher Hasegawa into a really... well, messy circumstance.\r\nIn a tale of corruption and decadence, Mikami will harshly learn that his &quot;pals&quot; aren't as loyal as initially advertized... but there is this one glimpse of hope for him, after all the beautiful pair of Asou-sensei and Hasegawa-sensei happen to have grown a little bit too attached to him, despite all of what he has done.",
