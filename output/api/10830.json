  "description": "Kinosaki Emu, captain of the table tennis club, is a large-breasted high schooler who loves table tennis even if she&rsquo;s bad at it.\r\nOpposite her is Yajima Esumi, her one-and-only club member, a sadist who&rsquo;s amazing at table tennis. Esumi throws insult after insult at Emu like calling her a fat pig or only good for her boobs.\r\nNot sitting idly by, Captain wishes to restore her dignity. She gives her all in matches and tries to get new members to join the club. But will this be enough? Will Captain restore her dignity?",
