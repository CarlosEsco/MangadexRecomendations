  "description": "Universal Century 0074, years before the One Year War, Zionic Corporation are on the verge of developing a new type of piloted powered mobile machine. The Zaku, &quot;The Father of all of all Mobile Suits&quot;, a title bestowed on to this mobile suit long after its creation &amp; deployment to the battlefield; but this is not the story of the Zaku's exploits during the Zeon War of Independence, later called the One Year War. Neither is this the story of a new type of piloted, independently powered mobile machine. A machine that would be powered using a thermonuclear reactor shielded with the revolutionary Minovsky particles as the power source, due to the secrecy and danger involved in a project of this kind, development was outsourced to Hosioka, a small steelworks industrial plant, this is their story.",
