  "description": "Matsubayashi wants to be friends with his prim and proper classmate Miyazen, and unbeknownst to him, the feeling is mutual. \r\nHowever, being a brash-looking delinquent, he has a lot of trouble communicating with her despite her valiant (and embarrassing) attempts to use references to his favourite media.\r\n\r\n[b]Links:[/b]\r\n[*][url=https://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=93587]Author's Pixiv[/url]\r\n[*][url=https://twitter.com/akihigh001]Author's Twitter[/url]\r\n\r\n[i]NOTE: The manga was serialized in Gangan Comic JOKER as [u]O Chikadzuki ni Naritai Miyazen-san[/u]. The serialized version is significantly different from the web comic version, not to be mistaken that both version are the same.[/i]",
