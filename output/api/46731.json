  "description": "The man she accidentally spent a night with was a formerly wolf-eared idol?!\r\n\r\n&quot;A 3 room apartment in the metropolitan area + a foreign car + retirement with guaranteed pension and savings.&quot;\r\nThose were the dream goals of 29-year-old pharmacist Han Sooji&rsquo;s, who used to be a passionate fan of the idol group &lt;LUPUS&gt; back in her school days.\r\n\r\nHowever, due to several problems and a member&rsquo;s departure, the group was forced to disband. Her young heart was scarred as she thought her steamy dreams were over, but&hellip;?\r\n\r\nLUPUS&rsquo;s former member, as well as the leading cause of the disbandment, is now getting ready to return to the entertainment world.\r\nAfter meeting Kim Beomchan, aka Jackie, and spending a bewildering night together, she promised to be a reliable friend. \r\n\r\nShe also learned about LUPUS&rsquo;s unfortunately troubling past from the former members\r\n\r\nSigh&hellip; Actually, this is pharmacist Han Sooji and &lsquo;Jackie&rsquo; the traitor&rsquo;s plan, &lsquo;hope for Kim Beomchan&rsquo;s safe and mishap free return&rsquo;!",
