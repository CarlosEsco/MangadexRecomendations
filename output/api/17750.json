After witnessing the tragic and dark side of the ever glamorous and royal facade of the GOD Civilzation, he decides to show these Gods of the new age the true definition of a God and redeem the universe from its cruel past. Determined to become the Supreme God master, he sets off on his quest. To face against the thousands of leagues of Gods in his way to the top , he must have a league of his own. The race to the throne is about to begin, but the first trial at the Grand Academy of  OURANIA awaits.",
