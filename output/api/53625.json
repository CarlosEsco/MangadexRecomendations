  "description": "Volume 1\r\n1-2) Welcome to the Chemistry Lab\r\nShibaura, the Chemistry teacher, usually seems gentle and kind but what is he really like in reality? Will Kousuke be safe in the Chemistry Club?\r\n\r\n3) Only You Would Steal me Away\r\nKobayashi is always appearing out of nowhere and clinging onto Kousuke's brother. What is his purpose? Is it just to help Kousuke and Shibaura, or is there more to it?\r\n\r\n4) The King's Lens\r\nTakeru has fallen in love with the photograph that Sumito has taken, but is strangely avoiding the photographer like the plague.\r\n\r\n5) A Grave Sin\r\nRyuuya's father has just passed away, and now he is forced to live with his uncle, who also happened to be his father's lover.\r\n\r\n6) I'm in Love With a Demon\r\nEveryone has always avoided Zenta because they thought he was creepy and geeky, except the cutesy Hibino Rei.\r\n\r\n6.1) Omake\r\nSome short stories on the main story.\r\n\r\nVolume 2\r\n1) The Illegitimate Couple\r\nIt's been 6 months, and Shuri is wondering if Kobayashi is really his lover. Kobayashi's memory is continuing to improve, and he remembers something about Shibaura Sensei and the pharmaceutical company he worked at, but he can't remember what. Is it good? Is it bad? Will it affect the relationship between Shibaura Sensei and Kousuke? Will Shuri and Kobayashi move their relationship past kissing?\r\n\r\n2-3) Welcome to the Chemistry Lab\r\nShibaura promised to call Kousuke during the holidays so they can meet up but he never did... The new school term started and Kousuke found out that he not only failed in his promise, Shibaura has completely disappeared without leaving any signs.\r\n\r\n4) No Place to Return\r\nSakuchi's father works in a large company that requires him to constantly be on the move.

Kobayashi keeps things from Shuri simply just because he doesn't want him to worry too much.\r\n\r\n2) Knockout\r\nDr. Kajiwara has been proposed to by his patient Mutsuhi but he is hesitating because he can't quite put Dr. Shibaura his high school crush completely out of his mind yet.\r\n\r\n3) The Night Will Finally End\r\nKousuke has finally gotten into his dream company, Yuazu Pharmaceuticals. Willl he finally be able to find Shibaura?\r\n\r\n4) Road of Fate\r\nMiki is in love with Kousuke but she can't confess her love for him because she can feel that he already has someone else that he loves.\r\n\r\n5-6) I Love You Too Much\r\nStory that was also published in chapter 1 and 2 of Ikura Nandemo Suki Sugiru .\r\n\r\n7) Character Profile\r\n\r\n8) Omake",
