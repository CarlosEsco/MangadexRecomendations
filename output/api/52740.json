  "description": "A comedic horror comic that even the faint of heart can read! Zhuyang bought alcohol after finding out that she will die at the hands of a female ghost the next day. When she wakes up the next day, her mind was in shambles because of her drunkenness and the house a mess. There is a female ghost hanging out of her tv. The female ghost is dead! All her bad friends accuse her of inhumanely torturing the female ghost. Zhuyang says, &quot;I'm not! I didn't! Don't spout such nonsense! I am as gentle as the tulbaghia, I only know how to scream when met with scary things.&quot; To this, the female ghost that everyone thought was dead, had a few words to say.",
