Ever since he first spotted Tatsukawa-Sensei, he confessed his feelings time and time again only to have the anti-social Tatsukawa-Sensei refuse every time. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! If I&rsquo;m not human, he will fall in love with me!&rdquo; Sensei then orders the dog cosplaying Yuuji to do what?\r\n\r\n2) Spoiled Guinea Pig\r\nWhen Kurosawa's beloved sempai comes to freeload at his house, how long can Kurosawa hold out?

Smex ensues.\r\n\r\n3) Secret Love Lesson\r\nHome-tutor Asato-sensei and his beautiful student Ren have confessed their feelings of love for eachother, and are ready to get their pants down.... now the only question is: Who gets whose ass?\r\n\r\n\r\n4) Feverish Eye complex\r\nAfter two years of being an extra, Yuzuru begins &quot;secret training&quot; with his new manager, hoping to become a first rate actor.

Is there any way for him to capture sempai's heart without joining the soccer team? ...How about some love potion \u2764 and maaaaybe an aphrodisiac?\r\n\r\n6) Drown in Love\r\nLil' cousin in love with big cousin. Big cousin is defenseless and touchy-feely... can lil' cousin take much more?!\r\n\r\n7) Triangle Love\r\nStrong and impulsive Hoshino Seita; Tall, beautiful Shinosaki Eiru; and finally, smart but shy Houyama Riku. A pure (lol) love story of the three classmates.\r\n\r\n8) Awkard Kiss \r\n\r\n9) Number Up! Split Boy",
