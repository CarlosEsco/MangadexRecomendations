  "description": "Coming from a prestigious middle school known for its sports, Ibuki Shin was one of the best pitchers in her softball club. Whereas, Kinomoto Yutsuki, from a regular school, was thought to possess outstanding talent as a hitter. The two stars are now enrolled in the same high school, but Shin decided to stop playing softball due to her hidden feelings for Yuki, while Yuki, oblivious to Shin's feelings, will not join the softball club without her. Each side recognizes the other's ability for the sport and wishes for their continuation. In hopes of persuading Shin into playing again, Yuki proposed a match between them, with the loser granting the winner's wish afterwards.",
