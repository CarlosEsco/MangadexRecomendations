  "description": "This is the adaptation of the award winning doujin novel that shocked Japan and sold over 130,000 copies within a month. It even outsold Haruki Murakami's long awaited novel, 'Killing Commendatore' domestically. \r\n\r\nWhile in the manga, it claims that it's just a work of fiction, the press release for the book by Fushosha, the publishing company, says (and I quote) &quot;'Otto no Chinpo ga Hairanai' is a shocking true tale that tells the story of a woman's life&quot;. It's about her relationship with school, society, men and women. It's about a woman that struggles with the curse that's 'normalcy', her struggle with impotence, cheating, and all that in between. \r\n\r\nComicalized by Gouto Yukiko (36-do, R-chuugakusei), a story of despair and hope, dedicated to all the people who have difficulty living, begins now.\r\n\r\n**This novel was recently adapted into a 10 (?) episodes dorama. For those that are interested, you can check it out!",
