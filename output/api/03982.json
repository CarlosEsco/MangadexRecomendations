Only One\r\nFollowing his divorce and subsequent loss of his apartment, Mochizuki moved in with Nagakura though they've barely been together for two weeks. A problem soon arises when Nagakura's colleague, Hayami, appears on the scene. Apparently Hayami is an ex-student of Mochizuki's. Just why has his appearance caused a sudden rift between the two lovers?\r\n\r\n3.

And what is this niggling feeling he feels for the older brother?\r\n\r\n4. Mousou Prize! (The Delusionary Prize!)\r\nShino has quite a crush on his cute tutor Akio. Akio promises Shino a reward if he can do well on his mock exams but what kind of reward is the student expecting? Will the tutor be forced to pay up?\r\n\r\n5. 17-sai no Paradox (A 17-Year-Old Paradox)\r\nKuroe is annoyed by his always-smiling teacher, Mizushiro. &quot;So you treat all your students equally? So annoying!&quot; Kuroe passes his boiling point and decides to take action in this ardent and thrilling school romance.\r\n\r\n6. Extras\r\nMizushiro tries to get Kuroe to say those magic words.",
