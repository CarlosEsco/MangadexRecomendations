  "description": "The main character and &quot;anti-hero,&quot; Rapeman, is a high school teacher by day and dispenses his surreal brand of &quot;justice&quot; at night under the business &quot;Rapeman Services,&quot; which is co-run with his uncle, a former surgeon. He uses rape as his weapon. The business' motto is &quot;Righting wrongs through penetration.&quot;\r\n\r\nClients call on Rapeman to handle cases such as the revenge of a jilted lover, forming parental bonds through a traumatic crisis, making disruptive co-workers more docile and other things of that nature. When engaged in his night trade, Rapeman wears a black leather ski mask shaped like the head of a penis but no trousers or underwear. In the middle of a rape, if the woman became unresponsive or appeared to be enjoying the violation, he would use a &quot;special technique&quot; such as &quot;M69 Screwdriver&quot; or &quot;Infinite Loop&quot; to apply more pain to the victim. He sometimes has regrets for the contracts he fulfills, but he always does the job.",
