  "description": "When Ragna the Bloodedge has to deal with the mindless, psychotic and constantly hungry catgirl Taokaka\r\nWhen Hakumen and Arakune decide to help damsels in distress as The Boundary Bros\r\nWhen Major Jin Kisaragi bullies his subordinate Noel Vermillion, all while Captain Hazama (aka Yuuki Terumi) abuses his very own subordinate Tsubaki Yayoi\r\n\r\nThat's when we know, the world has gone crazy.\r\nThe Wheel of Fate is turning, Rebel start!\r\n\r\nThis webcomic is based on the fighting game Blazblue by Arc System works, also known for the Guilty Gear series.\r\n\r\nFrom [url=http://blazen.thecomicseries.com/]Blazen The Comic Series[/url]\r\nIt&rsquo;s been fun making fun of Guilty Gear and BlazBlue over the years, but I&rsquo;ve finally reached a breaking point where I cannot continue the series anymore both in comic and video format. The Blazen comic site: blazen.thecomicseries.com/ and my YouTube channel: www.youtube.com/user/ShadowDraygonTV will remain up, but I will be no longer updating them. I hope you enjoy my twisted sense of humor over the years but it&rsquo;s caused me a great deal of stress and depression trying to continue making content.",
