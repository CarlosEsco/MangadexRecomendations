She begins to fall for Tsukina, Seiji's twin brother, who has always sacrificed for his sick brother. Tsukina believes that Seiji is in love with Hikari and steps back from the two, much to Hikari's dismay. What will happen to the three?\r\n\r\nReflect Me in Your Eyes\r\nKaro is in love with her childhood friend Tetsuro, but he seems to be in love with her older sister, Touko. One day, Tetsuro injures his eyes and Karo pretends to be her sister to make him happy. Will she be able to tell him the truth, or are things not as what they seem?\r\n\r\nFull-Point Kiss\r\nMeru (14) has a big crush on her tutor, Yuuri (19). She repeatedly fails her tests, and makes a deal with him - if she manages to get 100 on her test, he'll kiss her. Will she succeed?\r\n\r\nI'm Head-Over Heels In Love With You\r\nOn his first day of being in Osaka for university, Yuusuke is mistaken for a pervert after saving Suzuran from one on the train.

Yuusuke finds himself falling for Suzuran's bubbly and straightforward personality, but what are her real intentions? Is she just playing around with him?\r\n\r\nGift From Heaven Extra\r\nSeiji's real intentions are revealed in this 16-page extra",
