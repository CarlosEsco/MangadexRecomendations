  "description": "Compilation of short stories:\r\n\r\n[*] Kanojo no Honnou\r\nHer Instinct\r\n&quot;I want to crush every love that began with a love letter.&quot;\r\nNatsume began a relationship with a love letter. 3 months later, she got dumped. As she's walking home, she bumps into her classmate Aji-kun who's on his way to give a girl a love letter. Natsume decides to crush that love...\r\n\r\n[*] Todoketai\r\nWant to Reach You\r\n&quot;At home, along with the thoughs that make me choke inside... there's the 'make-believe family' that I have to pretend to be a part of...&quot;\r\nMana hates going home to a house with no one in it... but when her mother decides to remarry, Mana begins to hate going home even more. Because at home, there's Shin.\r\n\r\n[*] Mekakushi no Joousama\r\nThe Blindfolded Princess\r\n&quot;I'm the queen of the library... if I'm seen, I'll disappear.&quot;\r\nInoue Yoriko can't refuse when people ask her for things, so she gets bullied at school. The only reason she goes, is to see Maki - the guy she loves. She thinks he hate her, so she can't confess to him. But when he hears her voice in the library, and tells her he loves it, will Yoriko decide to show her face or stay hidden forever?\r\n\r\n[*] Multi-Vitamin\r\n&quot;You are just.... A vitamin drug.&quot;\r\nThat's what Ichimiya Ai says to a guy right before she dumps him. As she is walking in the hall, she sees her junior sleeping against the wall... but why is her heart beating just looking at him? When the guy, Natsu, asks her out, she accepts... but something feels different about him...\r\n\r\n[*] Lovex2 de Kishi\r\nLove Love Knight\r\n&quot;Quickly, throw me away already! Don't hurt me more than you already have...&quot;\r\nWhen Satsuki Mio confesses to the insanely popular ''Knight-kun'', she is so nervous she totally messes up (it's her first time confessing). Amused by her pureness, Knight-kun asks her to be his lover. At first, Mio can't believe she has such a good catch for her first boyfriend... but what if he doesn't really love her?",
