  "description": "Battleship Nagato must move forward despite her grief for her recently sunken sister ship, Mutsu. But in her attempts to do so, urged to action by the admiral, she encounters a civilian who looks exactly like the Mutsu she recently lost? With a construction of a new Mutsu in part two (a little Theseus' ship scenario) and explorations on the sociopolitical implications of 'ship girls' in a post-war society, this three-part series may be more than the common yuri oneshot.\r\n\r\nSource Link:\r\nhttps://www.pixiv.net/artworks/74991379\r\n\r\nSecond Chapter:\r\nhttps://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/hello_hello_second_part",
