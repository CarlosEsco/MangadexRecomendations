  "description": "Dayong area (modern day Zhangjiajie in Xiangxi region) is a place of grace and beauty. In 347 CE, the leader of Cult of Demons, Heixinhu, attempted to capture the sacred beast Qilin and drink its blood in order to raise his martial art power and take over wulin. Baimao, the father of Hongmao, with six other swords, defeated Heixinhu with the combined strength of Seven Swords. \r\n\r\n50 years later, Heixinhu returns, once again putting the world at risk. The only way to defeat the Cult of Demons is to reunite the Seven Swords once more. Hongmao, as a descending of the Seven Swords, must shoulder his ancient responsibility and find the other six swords in order to defeat the Cult of Demons and protect Qilin. \r\n\r\nA tale of wuxia heroes, modernized for a new generation of children, now begins.",
