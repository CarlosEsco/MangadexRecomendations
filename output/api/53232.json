  "description": "[i]Promotion for the novel.[/i]\r\n\r\nShe wanted to become the head of the family. Laetitia, left in the cold because she was an illegitimate child of the duke, was used as a successor. Her dedication to that was thwarted by Sujin, a foster daughter from that world. Her death was due to false charges. But after her final moments, she wakes up as an eleven year old girl again.\r\n\r\n&lsquo;In this life, I&rsquo;ll pave my own way forward.&rsquo;\r\n \r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to leave the family.&rdquo;\r\n \r\nLaetitia rids herself of the forsaken family and heads north. There, she meets the blood-and-iron minded Countess Winter, and offers a deal.\r\n \r\n&ldquo;Please sponsor me, Countess.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;What is a duke&rsquo;s daughter able to do for the Winters, if the Winters shelter you?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;In exchange for a contract, I will undo the curse lying on the Winters&rsquo; dominion.&rdquo;\r\n \r\nIn this second life, the more she tries to avoid it, the more she gets entangled in these dangerous but enchanting relationships&hellip;\r\n \r\n&ldquo;Acting as you please. You shouldn&rsquo;t have saved me, if you weren&rsquo;t going to look back at me.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Please leave the archmage, and take me as your husband.&rdquo;\r\n \r\nA turbulent second life. Will Laetitia be able to find a new family?\r\n[hr][url=https://twitter.com/vine_envi]Author's Twitter[/url]\r\n[url=https://twitter.com/_Yoteh]Artist's Twitter[/url]\r\n[url=https://twitter.com/MGMG_1012]Cover Artist's Twitter[/url]",
