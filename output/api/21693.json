  "description": "The students of Kamishiro High-School Class 2-A swore revenge on their homeroom teacher, Takao Nanami. Against her, a fake suicide had been concerted, meant to be played out by one of her students, whose actual death would later sink the class into confusion. Who soiled the water with blood? Skinned of its trust, their friendship became an urge to sate each other&rsquo;s hunger.",
