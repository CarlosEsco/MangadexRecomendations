  "description": "Seowoo, president of the film club, is standing outside in the rain, a welcome break from the noisy and chaotic bar behind her, when a girl with orange hair stumbles out the doors and practically into her arms. Then she begins singing &ldquo;Dancing in the Rain&rdquo; while... dancing in the rain. It&rsquo;s a minute encounter, really, but Seowoo has seen the greatest romances bloom from the smallest moments in the movies. So when Hayoung shows up to join the film club, Seowoo &ndash; who&rsquo;s not even sure what she herself is feeling &ndash; finds her heart skipping a beat.",
