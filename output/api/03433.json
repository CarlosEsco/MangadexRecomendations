  "description": "Onoda Nina is a 1st year student of her high school. She's having a serious crush on her senpai, the handsome and kind Atsuhito Ogi. Ogi is the president of the ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) club, and only to win his heart she joins the club. Turns out she has a tough rival, her senpai, Okada Ida who is a beauty and the idol of the school. Ida likes Ogi too and will never let Nina has his way with him. Soon they all find out that Nina actually possesses a powerful ESP, and this makes Ogi pays a lot of attention to her, much to her delight and Ida's distress. Thus begins the adventure of Nina and her friends in ESP club, and of course her 'battles' with Ida to win Ogi.\r\n\r\nSounds very simple and just like your everyday Shoujo, right? But here's the thing. This manga is a CRAZY, super COMEDY that leaves nothing not to be laughed about. It's hilarious, it's even outrageous, and I think you'll somewhat be embarrassed for Nina (and other characters) because she herself doesn't know shame. Nothing deep, nothing complicated, nothing intelligent, nothing really romantic about this manga. It's just here to make you laugh and laugh. Everything about this manga makes it an excellent bold comedy.",
