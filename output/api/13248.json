  "description": "Many years ago, an ancient civilization once ruled Earth. They were known for advanced artifacts and machines, but were destroyed in the end due to the misuse of their creations. Creating indestructible message plates written in Hebrew, these people left messages for later generations, informing them that if they could not find a good use for their creations, they should be destroyed.\r\n\r\nVarious entities such as paramilitaries, national armies and armed private forces began to secretly search for these &quot;mysterious&quot; artifacts in order to be used for their own good and against their enemies after the end of the Cold War. Only the ARCAM Corporation can stop these forces from destroying themselves with these &quot;advanced&quot; machines. With the help of its military arm, the ARCAM Private Army and their elite secret agents known as Spriggans (or Strikers), ARCAM plans to turn the tides of battle against those who would threaten the safety of humanity by using the dangerous artifacts.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Note[/u][/b]: \r\nViz's release for this manga doesn't follow the original structure, the available Viz chapters here are all of Viz's volume 1-3.",
