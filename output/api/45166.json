When Ginger&rsquo;s fiance, Kishon Mickelson, is stolen by Lerajie, Ginger decides she&rsquo;s had enough!\r\n\r\nBut one day, Ginger stumbles upon a strange novel - one where Lerajie is the main protagonist, and she is the villainess! She tries her best to ignore it, but when things start playing out just as written in the story, she has no choice but to rely on the novel to change her doomed future as the villainess. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Exactly what did I do to deserve this fate?! Why did I have to become the villainess?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nEnter the mysterious Prince Izana, the male lead of the novel. Confined within the depths of the Templar Tower for years by King Astor, he finally sees the light of day when his father passes away. But according to the novel, he&rsquo;s destined to fall in love with Lerajie, leaving Ginger to wallow in her own misery!\r\n\r\n&ldquo;All I ever did was live life as best I could! But as if stealing my fiance wasn&rsquo;t enough, now Lerajie is going to claim the male lead?! No way I&rsquo;ll let that happen!&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe &ldquo;villainess&rdquo; Ginger, who now knows Prince Izana&rsquo;s deepest secret (thanks to the novel), attempts to seduce him with -2% cautiousness and 200% cuteness!\r\n\r\n[hr][b][u]Russian / \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439:[/u][/b]\r\n[spoiler]\u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0451 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0435\u043b\u0451\u0433\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c, \u043d\u043e \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u044f\u043b\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0445\u0430 \u0438\u0437-\u0437\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0446\u044b, \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0443\u044e \u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0432\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0441 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0437\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434\u0430, \u043d\u043e \u0447\u0435\u043c \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0445\u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0451? \u041d\u0435\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0432 \u0440\u0443\u043a\u0438 \u0414\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0436\u0435\u0440 \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d. \u0412 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0441\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u041b\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0436\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0414\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0436\u0435\u0440, \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u041b\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0436\u0438\u044f \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0439, \u0430 \u0414\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0436\u0435\u0440 \u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0437\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0439\u043a\u043e\u0439. &laquo;\u041c\u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0437\u043b\u043e \u043f\u043e \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438, \u043d\u043e \u044f \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0430! \u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e, \u041b\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0436\u0438\u044f, \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u0442\u044b \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438\u043d\u044f, \u0442\u043e \u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0443 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0437\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0435\u0432! \u0418 \u044f \u043e\u0431\u044f\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u044e \u0442\u0430\u043a, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0438\u0437 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u0432\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f!&raquo;.[/spoiler]",
