The one who appeared in front of him was his kouhai, once a beautiful and gentle angel, Fubuki. &ldquo;Senpai never came to look for me after graduation. So I want to make you mine even if I have to do it by force.&rdquo; After saying that, Fubuki did everything he could. He&rsquo;s so obsessed with Asagami and even put aphrodisiacs into his food. Will Asagami give in?\r\n\r\n5.
