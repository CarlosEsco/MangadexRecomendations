  "description": "As unpopular as DDD itself. A story featuring featuring &ldquo;Ookumaneko Mokumoku&rdquo; -until then just a side character- and a well-known little sister: &ldquo;Ishizue Kanata&rdquo;. Shunji Enomoto drew a short manga based on its events (pic related).\r\n\r\nAcross the story we can see a Kanata with the urge to kill some time (and other things), making her way out of her chamber (more like a prison) with the help of the docile Origa Vice-president. Then, Kanata resolves going to a room nobody has stepped in for a long time. That room was located in her own ward; &ldquo;Ward D&rdquo; and its number was: &ldquo;The Room No.404&Prime;, however, as this room was a mystery to even those patients (monsters) of Ward D and even though what lied inside resulted very attractive to pry into, no one tried doing it before, after all, the Hospital files didn&rsquo;t even consider an active room anymore.\r\n\r\nBefore she destroys the iron door intruding in her way, a dim, puzzling voice spoke a few words, resembling a warning to her:\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come in. Don&rsquo;t come in. You cannot withstand my power. If you come in you&rsquo;ll regret it.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Cherish life, don&rsquo;t enter my world.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&hellip;this of course was the voice of Mokumoku, a 30 years old NEET who hid an unimaginable power.",
