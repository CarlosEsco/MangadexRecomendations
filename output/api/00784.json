  "description": "1) Zenbu Shiritai\r\n(I Want to Know Everything)\r\nI won&rsquo;t act spoiled in front of my boyfriend, and I definitely won&rsquo;t trouble him, either. I&rsquo;m trying to act like a cool and mature ideal girlfriend, but the truth is, I&rsquo;m a persistent and annoying girl who wants to be pampered by her boyfriend! Even though I'm hiding my true self from him, to satisfy my evil desires, I&rsquo;m stalking my beloved boyfriend!!\r\n\r\n2) Sakasama Honey\r\n(Upside Down Honey)\r\nKameyama Chisato is a girl without boyfriend, because of her sadistic personality. While trying to fix it by secretly practicing with a skeleton in the Biology lab, a classmate named Kurosawa Akihiro sees her. What will happen to her secret?! Will Chisato ever find love??\r\n\r\n3) Chiru Chiru Michiru\r\n(Fall, Fall, Rise/ Broken-hearted Michiru)\r\nMichiru is a girl with poor luck when it comes to love. She&rsquo;s been dumped several times by her boyfriends for other girls. After her latest breakup, she feels really dejected. In her attempt to get over her love, she pretends as if she's about to commit suicide. However, a boy from her school, who is rumoured to be a delinquent, stops her, and promises her that he&rsquo;ll introduce her to the best guy on earth. Just who is this 'best guy on earth' and where can he be found? Or is he right in front of Michiru&rsquo;s eyes?\r\n\r\n4) Ashita Hanabi ga Agattara\r\n(When There's Fireworks Tomorrow)\r\nTomoe has a dream\u30fc to go to the fireworks display during the summer together with the guy she likes. However, she hasn&rsquo;t found that spark of love at all, at least, not until her childhood friend, Miki, moves back to her school and she meets Kagami through him! She makes the perfect plan to confess to him, but that doesn&rsquo;t go as well as she had hoped, when Kagami confesses to her that he really likes Tomoe&rsquo;s best friend, Rikka! Is the friendship ruined between these best friends now? And will Tomoe be able to fulfill her dream of watching the fireworks with someone she loves?\r\n\r\n5) Super\u2730Star\r\nThere&rsquo;s a certain group of guys in Kiyoko&rsquo;s class that stands out, and to Kiyoko, Hoshino stands out the most! In fact, whenever she sees him, he looks like he&rsquo;s sparkling. However, Kiyoko realises that Hoshino isn&rsquo;t exactly what he seems to be, when she discovers him working at his family&rsquo;s run-down convenience store! But even in his dull work clothes, Hoshino is still sparkling to her. But it&rsquo;s not until Hoshino is confessed to by another girl that Kiyoko truly realizes that even if she&rsquo;s different from Hoshino&rsquo;s ideal girl, she still has a chance&hellip; but is it too late now for her?",
