  "description": "Fujihashi Ryo enjoys her job as an office worker well enough, but it doesn&rsquo;t hold a candle to the exciting job of her childhood friend Mizuno Souma, who works as a fireman. He and his handsome buddies are more than happy to entertain ladies with their heroic tales. Ryo wants to set up Souma with a girl in her office, but he&rsquo;s too much of a playboy to settle down&hellip;or so she thinks. It turns out that he has the hots for her, and when he rescues her from a fire in her building, a different kind of spark begins to fly!\r\n[hr][url=https://twitter.com/tanishi_kawano][img]https://i.imgur.com/dQCXZkU.png[/img]Mangaka's Twitter[/url]\r\n[url=https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/1430739][img]https://i.imgur.com/oiVINmy.png[/img] Mangaka's Pixiv[/url]\r\n\r\nSee [url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=22242]AnimeNewsNetwork[/url] for the anime.",
