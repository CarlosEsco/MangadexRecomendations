Fufu.\r\n\r\n&quot;Daddy, why is your name also daddy? So cute.&quot;\r\n&quot;What did you eat for breakfast? Handsomeness?&quot; \r\n\r\nAs I dream of a happy ending for Daddy, there's just one more huge obstacle&hellip;\r\nThe existence of the hero who would kill the final boss.\r\n\r\nNow that it's come to this, let's save my bias and the hero as an addition! If I have time, maybe the world too! However&hellip;\r\n\r\n&quot;I'll kill you if you approach my daughter.&quot;\r\n\r\n...Daddy keeps on raising the death flags.\r\n\r\n&quot;You should take responsibility since you tamed me.&quot;\r\n\r\nSomehow the hero is also obsessed over me, just what's going on&hellip;?\r\n[hr][i]Note: This is a oneshot promotional manhwa for the novel of the same name [/i]",
