His main interest is his motorcycle. Kikumasamune Seishiro is the rich son of a large hospital's head doctor. He also fights as well as Miroku. He is a good fighter with smart moves. \r\nBido Granmarie is the son of a Swedish ambassador. He's also a playboy, dating many girls at once: can't see himself going steady because he thinks the world can't handle it. \r\n\r\nKenbishi Yuri is the rich daughter of a world-renowned president of the Kenbishi Business. She loves to indulge on eating. She's also a good fighter, but can never beat Seishiro. \r\nHakushika Noriko's parents are a famous japanese painter (father) and a traditional tea ceremony mother. Her only hate is men and can get very violent when they touch her. \r\nKizakura Karen lives with her mother, a rich jewel dealer. Her dream is to marry into a rich family using her attractive body and style. \r\n\r\nTogether, they formed the Yukan Club, solving mysteries to pass time.\r\n\r\n1986 Kodansha Manga Award winner for Shojo",
